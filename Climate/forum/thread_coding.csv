 Having grown up on a barrier island in Southern New Jersey, I have become quite aware of the power and fury of the sea. Coastal storms or ""nor’easters"", have wrecked havoc on barrier islands along the Jersey Coast.
 
 Although a few years before my time, the “Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962” was considered by the U.S. Geological Survey to be one of the most destructive storms ever to affect the mid-Atlantic states. In fact, it has been suggested that this storm was one of the ten worst in the United States during the 20th century. It was responsible for the deaths of 40 people, injured more than 1,000 and caused hundreds of millions in property damage.
 
 More recently, Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in Atlantic City around 8:00 p.m. on October 29th, was the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history. $37 billion of its $64 billion in damages occurred in New Jersey. The storm ended as the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, having been measured at 1,100 miles in diameter.
 
 Most recently, on January 23, 2016, winter storm Jason pounded the southern New Jersey coast with wind gusts approaching hurricane strength. Many coastal communities witnessed water levels exceeding those of Hurricane Sandy. Several areas throughout the northeast saw more snow from this single storm than that which typically occurs during the entire winter season.
 
 Storms such as the “Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962” and “Superstorm Sandy” are often dubbed “Storms of the Century”. However, due to the serious and significant impacts of climate change, these types of storms are predicted to occur much more frequently.
 
 The National Climate Assessment 2014 in a section specifically highlighting the northeastern U.S., notes that “infrastructure, agricultural, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised.” This report continues in stating that this area of the country has experienced a greater increase in extreme precipitation than any other region. In fact, between 1958 and 2010, the northeast has seen a 70% increase in precipitation falling in “very heavy events.”
 
 The Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment (NECIA), a collaboration between the Union of Concerned Scientists and more than fifty independent experts, has noted that the northeast has been warming .5 degrees per decade. In addition to an increase in coastal storms, this area will be negatively impacted due to climate change. Under a “higher emissions scenario” it is estimated that by late in this century, this area will experience summer temperatures between 6 and 14 degrees higher than average. Hemlock, maple, birch, and beech trees would either be eliminated or shift north. Apple, blueberry, cranberry and milk production would decrease while diseases such as West Nile virus and Lyme Disease would increase. Extreme coastal flooding would occur much more regularly. For example, Atlantic City, one town over from my childhood home, would witness “once a century” flooding occur once every year or two.
 
 In an article published in the Boston Globe (May 7, 2014) the authors David Abel and Matt Viser take information from a recent federal report on climate change. They caution that if current rates of emissions continue, the northeastern states will witness extreme heat, taxing electrical systems and disrupted ecosystems. Both coastal and river flooding will increase. In fact, “heat waves, coastal flooding and river flooding will pose a growing challenge to the region’s environmental, social and economic systems.”
 
 The barrier island of Brigantine where I was born and raised, is seeking to adapt to the reality of increasingly numerous and dangerous coastal storms by requiring property owners, when initiating property improvements, to increase the height of their bulkheads. This strategy has not only proven to be ineffective but, more importantly, will do little to mitigate the serious dangers that lie ahead. Rather than pursue a strategy of adaptation, it is incumbent upon each individual, municipality, state and country to work cooperatively in the development and implementation of strategies to reduce and prevent the effects of climate change.",t
GlennTamblyn,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56a6122ba66778052d000db4,initial_post,Anyone want to actually see the GH Effect?,6,"Spoiler Alert. Don't read this until you have worked through Sara's lectures in module 3.
 
 Once you have worked through Sara's lectures about energy budgets you might find this material interesting. It is more technical than the lectures could be, perhaps more technical than you need or are interested in. However there might be some interest for you.
 
 And at the end I can show you a graph, measured from a satellite in 1969, where the effect of CO2 is immediately visible. And it highlights the level of depth and detail to which the scientists understand all this.
 
 Lets start with Sara's graph of the spectrum from the Sun and Earth. 
 
 ![enter image description here][1]
 
 As Sara said, Wiens Law lets us calculate what wavelength the peak of the curve will be at based on the temperature of the object radiating. And the Stefan-Boltzmann Eqn tells us the total amount of heat being radiated.
 
 This is actually the area under that curve. And there is a 3rd eqn that relates Wien and Stefan-Boltzmann to each other. It is called Planck's Law - this is like a who's who of great 19th century physicists. You can read about it [here][2] - the formula is rather complicated math. 
 
 Planck's Law describes the shape of the spectrum curve, based on the temperature of the object, Wien's Law works out the location of the peak of Planck's curve, and Stefan-Boltzmann calculates the area under Planck's curve.
 
 As an object gets hotter this curve shifts to the left on Sara's graph of wavelengths. From infrared to visible to ultra-violet. And it gets brighter, so the curve grows taller. Importantly however the shape of the curve doesn't change - it slides and stretches but keeps the same shape. When we look at a single object glowing at a certain temperature we expect to see this curve. And most things do look this way, broadly speaking.
 
 This is the spectrum for the Sun, measured by satellites. The yellow curve is from above the atmosphere. As you can see it matches the Planck curve Sara showed pretty well. And the orange curve is what reaches the surface, after reflection from the clouds and absorption by the atmosphere. See how much of the ultra-violet is absorbed by the ozone layer, and the absorption by water vapour and oxygen. There is even a tiny bit of absorption by CO2 at a wavelength of around 2000 nanometers - 2 micrometers (microns). This is a tiny contribution from CO2. It's main effect is on radiation going out to space. The main action as far as radiation to space from the Earth is concerned is far to the right off this graph, at wavelengths between around 5000 to 30,000 nanometers (5 to 30 microns)
 ![enter image description here][3]
 
 
 
 So, in early 1969 NASA launched a satellite, Nimbus 3. It was used to test a range of instruments that could be used for observing the Earth. One of those instruments was a Michelson Infrared Interferometer. A device that could actually measure the infrared spectrum coming up from the Earth - the Planck Curve. 
 
 In April 1969, months before Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon, an experiment was carried out using the satellite. A weather balloon was launched from near Galveston in Texas on the Gulf of Mexico coast. As it ascended it measured air temperatures, pressures and humidity in the air column above Galveston. And it was launched so that Nimbus 3 was passing overhead as it rose. So Nimbus 3 was looking down at this region at the same time the weather balloon was rising through it.
 
 In 1970 a scientific paper was published covering a range of studies using this interferometer, including this experiment. At this point in time they were still evaluating all the things an instrument like this could be used for. So a lot of the paper is quite technical. The paper is called 'THE INTERFEROMETER EXPERIMENT ON NIMBUS 3'. Cited as Conrath et al 1970 [here][4].
 
 A dry, dusty name but several graphs from page 54 to 60 are really important.
 
 This is the first. Two curves. One is the spectrum from the earth, as measured by the satellite - the range of wavelengths on the graphs isn't the full spectrum, just most of it - it was limited by the range the instrument can measure.
 
 The other is the spectrum calculated using the measurements from the weather balloon to provide data for a theoretical calculation using the physics of radiation transfer and the properties of the GH gases. 
 ![enter image description here][5]
 Basic science. Make a prediction from theory and compare it to observations.
 
 As you can see the two curves are very similar, but are one above the other. **This is because the two curves, theory and observations actually matched so well that you almost couldn't tell them apart. So they shifted one of them up by a bit, just so they could be told apart.** Look at the graph below. It shows half the data from the first graph without the vertical displacement. They match almost perfectly.
 
 And reading the text of the paper, these results and the degree of agreement between theory and observation didn't surprise anyone. They expected them and were more interested in the fine details of accuracy.
 
 Think about this. In 1969, with simpler instruments than today, with far less computer power available, the knowledge of all this was sufficiently well developed that they could get almost everything right and weren't even surprised!
 
 So look at the first graph again. They have labelled several regions of the graph - H2O (Water), Ozone, CH4 (Methane). And one called H2O Rotational. This is an aspect of GH gases that Sara wasn't able to mention. Water molecules have a permanent bend in them whereas CO2 is straight when it is at rest and only gets a bend when it vibrates. So water's charge separation that Sara discussed is permanent whereas CO2's only appears when it bends. With a permanent charge separation, it isn't just vibrations of the molecule that can absorb energy, it is also rotations. Water can absorb radiation via vibrations and rotations, and this happens in two different parts of the spectrum.
 
 Finally, there is a section labelled CO2. This is the part of the spectrum where CO2 absorbs. It isn't as broad as the H2O parts, but it is very deep. A big chunk taken out of the graph.
 
 Now look at the broad shape of the graph and imagine the Planck curve. We can see it there. But pieces of it are missing, like mice have been eating some of the cheese. Remember that the total energy is the area under the curve from the relationship between Stefan-Boltzmann and Planck. So if there is less area under the curve because of what the GH gases are doing, there is less energy going out to space. 
 
 **This is directly observing the GH effect.** And that deep notch is due to CO2. Sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. So next time you hear a climate skeptic claim that there is no evidence of CO2's role in climate, remember this graph.
 
 And this isn't a one off. Satellites have been observing this since 1969. They have observed different parts of the earth to see the differences in this effect from place to place for nearly 1/2 a century.
 
 **Some more detail if you want to drill deeper.** 
 
 Look at the graph above. The region between the two H2O regions, where the word 'observed' is. There are no GH gases mentioned here. This is sometimes called the 'Atmospheric Window'. The region of the spectrum where none of the GH gases are active. Sara mentioned this. In the energy balance graph she showed, there was 40 Watts/M^2 that went straight out to space. That is what goes through this part of the spectrum. What the satellite measured in this part of the spectrum came directly from the surface. And everything else in this spectrum **didn't** originate from the surface. It is radiation from higher in the atmosphere.
 
 This Atmospheric Window is important. It allows astronomers to see at least part of the infrared radiation from stars, galaxies etc. from the ground without it being distorted by the atmosphere. And sadly it has military applications. Heat-seeking air-to-air missiles use the atmospheric window to see the radiation from an aircrafts engines clearly without distortion.
 
 Now look at the next graph, more detail, this the left hand half of the first graph. Notice how they have plotted the measurements and observations without any displacement. Apart from some small discrepancies, they are almost perfect matches. From the state of science in 1969!
 ![enter image description here][6]
 
 
 
 
 Then they have also plotted hypothetical Planck curves for different temperatures - in Kelvin.
 
 Look at the region on the right of the notch, the atmospheric window. It lies between the 280 and 300 Kelvin Planck curves. Roughly at around 295 Kelvin - 22 Celsius. Now look at the graph further down. This is from page 60 in the paper and the solid line shows the actual temperatures the weather balloon measured. Heights are given as pressure rather than actual meters because the balloons don't have a radar altimeter and the convention in Meteorology is to describe heights based on air pressure. 
 
 And near the ground the temperature is roughly 295 Kelvin. We can see the temperature of the ground from the Planck curve!
 
 Now look at the other region to the left in the detail graph. Part of the H2O rotational region. The temperatures from the Planck curves vary between 240 and 280 Kelvin. -33 C to +7 C. This reflects the fact that different parts of the H2O spectrum are originating from different heights in the atmosphere. Mainly the middle to lower troposphere. 
 
 Now look at the CO2 'notch'. The bottom of the notch matches a Planck curve for 220 Kelvin - -53 C. Now look at the balloon data. That roughly matches the temperatures at the 300 to 50 mB pressure levels. The lower Stratosphere where temperatures are at their coldest but stop getting colder with altitude. Now look at the little peak at the centre of the CO2 notch. That has a slightly higher 'planck temperature'. Not because we are lower in the atmosphere; because we are higher. That corresponds to more like 235 Kelvin. From even higher still, in the upper stratosphere where temperatures start to rise again. 
 
 We can 'read' a spectrum like this to start to understand how the different parts of the spectrum are coming from different heights in the atmosphere. We can look at a spectrum from a hot dry location. The atmospheric window will show the high ground temperature while the H2O sections won't be as different from that because water vapour drops off sharply with altitude. We can look at a spectrum from a hot wet location. Still high temperature observed in the window but the H2O region will be more different because, with more water in the air, you have to go higher and cooler before concentrations drop to allow radiation to space. We can look at a spectrum from the polar regions in winter. Virtually no H2O - it's too cold. And we can see the temperature inversions where the surface is colder than the upper air.
 
 We can do all this because we know, in detail, how all this happens in the atmosphere.
 
 ![enter image description here][7]
 
 
 
 
 
 **Had enough? Or want to geek out even further?**
 
 How do we know all of this? Because we know the properties of GH gases in exquisite detail. Not just theory. Observations. 
 
 The [HiTran][8] Spectroscopic database is one of the most important (although not the only) database of the detailed measurements of the absorption properties of various gases present in the atmosphere. It's current version has data on 42 different gases in the atmosphere including all the major ones. 120 different [isotopologues][9] of those gases. And over 7 million individual absorption 'lines'. The database is currently maintained by the Atomic and Molecular Physics Division, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. However its origins go back to the Cold War, starting with research funded by the US Air Force in the 1950's. They wanted to build air-to-air heat-seeking missiles and needed to understand what happened in the atmosphere. In detail. It has grown from there.
 
 It is now used for military purposes; NASA, the European Space Agency etc. use it in all their planetary science work; it is used in a wide range of product developments of commercial products; it is used in understanding how the satellites that measure air temperatures for weather forecasting work. Oh and it is used to understand the GH Effect.
 
 The data from HiTran is available to anyone. You can download it. They have a process and a bit of rigmarole but anyone can get it. But it is a VERY big data file with lots of numbers, and what they mean is quite technical. But it ain't secret.
 
 This [website][10] offers a convenient interface to HiTran so you can look at just what you might be interested in. Their [Line List Browser][11] lets you extract the HiTran data for any gas, over any range of wavelengths. This is the data for CO2 in the wavelengths we are interested in.
 
 ![enter image description here][12]
 
 Essentially this is how strongly CO2 absorbs at different wavelengths - in serious, serious detail. There are over 90,000 separate lines here. The vertical scale is logarithmic. So the difference between -20 and -22 on this scale is a difference of 100 in strength of absorptivity. Notice that the peak of this graph is a bit below 15 microns. Exactly matching the centre of the little peak in the middle of the CO2 notch in the graph from Conrath et al above!
 
 And it goes deeper. SpectralCalc lets one download the [detailed numbers from HiTran][13] for the area you are looking at.
 
 It looks like this:
 
  25 562.393650 8.450e-30 3.513e-01.0705.0960 2720.46290.73-.000709 2 1 1 03 1 2 2 02 P 24e 4377541221 5 4 5 7 94.0 98.0

 Oooh Yuck, numbers!!!
 
 But in here we have the basic Spectral Intensity, the raw indicator of absorptivity. We have the Einstein A Coefficient, that plugs into Einsteins equations for estimating emission. It includes detailed data used for evaluating how those 90k+ lines get broadened due to collisions, air temperature etc. 
 
 There is more detail here than any of us can grasp. So, do I understand all of this? Nope. Some yes but this nuts-and-bolts detail is way above my pay-grade. And I haven't even begun to try to delve into the quantum mechanics of why all of this is so - my head would explode.
 
 But specialists in these fields do. This is their day job. These folks don't spend their days throwing darts at dart boards and guessing a lot. They work much much harder than that. But maybe we don't understand that.
 
 You may not understand all of this - I don't. But some people do. Surely we should listen to them?

dilekdoratekin,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56ded2e9ce92900528000405,initial_post,Assignment 2 Carbon Cycle Human Activities,0,"Assignment 2 Carbon Cycle Human Activities
 Istanbul’s off the record population is over 20 million and there are estimated 3.5 million cars. One person smokes 1499 cigarettes for one year.
 Carbon is vitally important for earth and life. Carbon follows a certain route on earth and this action called carbon cycle. Carbon cycle is based on carbon dioxide (CO2), which can be found in air in gaseous form and in water in dissolved form.
 Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which basically means that too much carbon dioxide in air causes the earth to warm up. Humans emit great amounts of carbon dioxide during combustion processes and because of this, the greenhouse effect consisted. The greenhouse effect means that the climate is affected by the concentrations of greenhouse gasses on earth
 Projecting climate into the future and forecating regional impacts depends on our understanding of the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans and land ecosytems
 Respiration 
 Plants (and photosynthetic algae and bacteria) then use some of the stored carbohydrates as an energy source to carry out their life functions. Some of the carbohydrates remain as biomass (the bulk of the plant, etc.). Consumers such as animals, fungi, and bacteria get their energy from this excess biomass either while living or dead and decaying. Oxygen from the atmosphere is combined with carbohydrates to liberate the stored energy. Water and carbon dioxide are byproducts. 
 oxygen + carbohydrate -> energy + water + carbohydrate 
 O2 + CH2O -> energy + H2O + CO2 
 Notice that photosynthesis and respiration are essentially the opposite of one another. Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with O2. Respiration takes O2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with CO2. However, these processes are not in balance. Not all organic matter is oxidized. Some is buried in sedimentary rocks. The result is that over geologic time, there has been more oxygen put into the atmosphere and carbon dioxide removed by photosynthesis than the reverse. 
 If CO2 concentration increases in the atmosphere because of an increased rate of outgassing, global temperature will rise. Rising temperature and more dissolved CO2 will lead to increased weathering of crustal rocks as a result of faster reaction rates (temperature effect) and greater acidity. Enhanced weathering will use up the excess CO2 thereby cooling the climate. 
 If global temperature cools as a result of some astronomical forcing or tectonic/ocean circulation effect, the lower temperatures will result in lower rates of chemical weathering. Decreased weathering means less CO2 being drawn from the atmosphere by weathering reactions, leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere to increase temperatures. 
 If more rocks become available for rapid weathering as a result of mountain uplift the enhanced weathering will draw down atmospheric CO2 and decrease global temperatures. But the decreased temperatures will slow reaction rates, thereby using less CO2, thus allowing temperatures to moderate.
  Istanbul’s off the record population is over 20 million and there are estimated 3.5 million cars. One person smokes 1499 cigarettes for one year. Burnning coals, smokestacks, exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere.
 The spesific CO2 molecules that come out of the smokestacks and exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere for only a few years on average but they don’t vanish after that time rather, they end up in other parts of the carbon cycle ( most likely absorbed in the ocean or by a plant) Other CO2 molecules are swapping places with those CO2 molecules all the time, but the total amount in the cycle is increasing because of our emissions. The question isn’t how long an individual carbon dioxide molecule stay in the atmosphere.. It is how long extra population of molecules sticks around. The answer is that is at least hundreds of years, and that’s the period when our climate will feel warming effect
 Photosynthesis, respiration and CO2 absorption/release from the ocean surfaces are all examples of natural fluxes of carbon through the Earth's systems. Human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning and deforestation, disrupt this natural flux by releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. When we mine coal and extract oil from the Earth and then burn these fossil fuels for transportation, heating, cooking, electricity and manufacturing, we are effectively moving carbon more rapidly into the atmosphere than is being removed from the atmosphere naturally through the sedimentation of carbon. This causes the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase, which leads to global warming. Also, by clear-cutting forests to support agriculture, we are transferring carbon from living biomass into the atmosphere. Because of this, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is higher than it has ever been
  Fossil fuels represent carbon storage areas. Carbon that is locked in these fossil fuels does not cycle through the Earth. When humans burn fossil fuels, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The carbon is then free to cycle through the Earth and can upset the natural balance of the carbon available, changing the way that processes occur on Earth.

There is a consilience of evidence about global warming (surface temperature. sea ice, night time and winter temperature rising, extreme weather events increasing, coral bleaching etc). All of these things have tangible effects on our energy consumption or tourism and it doesn't make sense to try to make economic decisions without recourse to the facts that emerge from scientific data. To use political expediency as a basis for policy change is akin to voting on whether the earth is flat or round.",t

I knew a little about climate science going in - now I know a whole lot more. And while I was concerned before with the direction of things in our world today, now I see the reason why we ALL need to be aware of the types of scientific evidence presented here about climate change, and not just be aware, but also be more vocal about sharing facts and engaging people in discussions.
 
 Thank you to the TA's for your help and participation in the forums. You added a lot to the class as a whole. I've done quite a few MOOCs and the TA support and participation here is first rate.
 
 Thank you also to all of my fellow students. I enjoyed reading your essays and learning about climate change in your regions. There are so many more things going on than I could have ever imagined, and to see and hear from those of you who are living those effects was truly a highlight of this course. I hope to see some of you in the future in other on-line learning communities. 
 
 Though this course was a little different for me (my usual areas of study being astrophysics and mathematics) I am really glad I took this one. This is an election year here in the United States and while I doubt that climate change will be one of the foremost topics, it will come up. And that will offer many opportunities to exchange information with others here about the importance of being aware of, and engaged in, topics concerning the reality of climate change. I feel much more prepared to do that now that I have studied it here. Thanks again!!!",s

My name is Ethelberto; I reside in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, West Africa. I am a postgraduate student of Sustainable Development and find this course very informative.
 
 Linking Climate Science to Sustainable Development is key to understanding our Earth System and helping policy makers make informed decisions to mitigate and adapt to effects of climate change both at local, regional and international scales. We are almost at the ""tipping point"" and there is no time to waste, despite all the climate change deniers!
 
 The works of IPCC buttresses the fact that science without practice is waste of resources. Thanks to the just concluded COP21 conference in Paris, science and development are merging in sustainable ways and we are thankful to IPCC and other observers and modellers of our dear Earth. 
 
 Are the advocates of Mainstream Sustainable Development therefore winning? Would appreciate your comments.
 
 Thank you.

 Stabilizing: Holding one's breath will cause a build-up of carbon dioxide in one's bloodstream, since metabolically active cells excrete CO2 as a waste product of cellular metabolism. This CO2 will lower the pH of one's bloodstream and will trigger an increase in breathing rate. There are chemoreceptors in the body which force you to breathe after a certain period of time. We then exhale CO2, which in turn lowers the amount in the bloodstream, returning it to a normal, stabilized level. Most physiological changes in the body follow a ""stabilizing"" pattern.
 
 Amplifying: (1) If you were to cut a major artery, like the femoral or carotid, your body's barorecepors (pressure) would detect a loss of blood pressure. Trying to keep the brain well supplied with blood, its response would be to have the heart pump faster and harder - causing you to bleed to death faster.
 
 Or (2) our psychological/physiological response to narcotic pain killers. People who take Norco/Codeine/Oxycontin will experience a need for a higher dosage over time to achieve the same results. Receptors in the brain decrease in number as the system is flooded with these artificial opiates. Since there are fewer receptors, we need more of the opiate to achieve the same level of pain relief. So even with more Norco, we experience more pain, so we take more, and it becomes even less effective",T

I think it skews the results of the study; you hardly can find a scientist who would deny some level of human contribution as the increased CO2 level simply has to increase the temperature a bit, but I would not call this a consensus on anthropogenic cause.

Social values and partisan affiliations are much more predictive of a person's acceptance of climate change, particularly in America (although other countries like the U.K. and Australia have shown similar divides in public perception). As such, scientists might consider taking a more active role in collaborating with communications specialists--which may include educators--in order to communicate accurate, up-to-date science through different frames, which may resonate with more audiences. By helping to craft language that appeals to common values--such as stewardship and preparedness--or working with trained spokespeople who can deliver these messages, scientists can help change public perception, thus influencing decision-makers who are beholden to their constituents. Or scientists can directly reach out to decision-makers with curated messaging that might resonate in a particular region/community/census block. None of this is to say that scientists should stop being objective and rigorous in their research; it is merely to say that by pairing the science with the communications needed to make the science resonate, the role of science in decision-making has the potential to improve exponentially.",T

RPTor,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56d4b11122a8fb050c0009e7,initial_post,Course Evaluation from a student,0,"I appreciate the opportunity to view this informative, introductory course on climate change. Especially useful to me were the provided model simulations such as PhET group U. Colorado blackbody spectrum in Ch 3.1, the EEC Milankovitch cycle simulation in Ch. 2.4, climate model simulations such as UCAR from Randy Russell in Ch. 5.3, and many documents from various US and European sources. I also appreciate the copious references to contradictory opinions. 
 
 There were some disappointments. My doubt over the instructor's suggestion of a net energy flux into the earth's system (input exceeds output) led to a search for corroboration. The numbers imply a measurement precision of about 0.2% - dubious to me unless one is using the same measurement technique for equivalent quantities( say a ruler and a height-not different flavors of quantities with the same units)
 
 So I referred to a published article which addressed my doubts in the course 'discussion' section. The response -which I judge mostly irrelevant- from one of the course 'monitors' - seemed mainly intended to disparage competence of the authors and the journal itself.
 
 I maintain that the data for a net imbalance are not reliable. A more recent article (I have access to the abstract only) may give weight to this. In “An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations”, Graeme L. Stephens et. al. Nature Geoscience 5, 691–696 (2012) , the authors suggest a revision of energy flux input from updated surface and satellite data imaging:
 “Specifically, the long wave radiation received at the surface is estimated to be significantly larger, by between 10 and 17 Wm−2, than earlier model based estimates. Moreover, the latest satellite observations of global precipitation indicate that more precipitation is generated than previously thought. This additional precipitation is sustained by more energy leaving the surface by evaporation — that is, in the form of latent heat flux — and thereby offsets much of the increase in long wave flux to the surface.” I take this to mean decreased net energy flux into the earth- which seems to be at odds with the net excess energy flux suggested in the course (Of course I should expect the integrity of these authors and the that of the journal to be questioned.)
 
 It was additionally disappointing that the competence of that certain eniment physicists (not climate scientists) who challenge climate change orthodogy is questioned rather than their proposed explanations.
 
 On another issue: Scientific 'consensus'. This can be viewed simply as general agreement over the same error. Early in the twentieth century many competent scientists attempted to demonstrate 'ether' as a medium allowing the proagtion of light -until careful experiments and the explanation of Einstein's special relativity. 
 
 It may the case that rising global temperatures are accompanied by increased CO2 but in a non causal manner. I suggest a more careful objective -less religious like -approach is needed.
 
 As for me, I have evolved from 'open' to 'less skeptical about the skeptics'.",T

 'Should' is a slippy word. I feel confident that as you read it, in the context of the question above, your understanding will be different from mine. Does it mean 'must' be involved? Does it mean prioritising scientific advice? Does it mean actually being decision makers? And whose 'science' are we talking about?
 
 I 'should' of course take more exercise, and eat healthier food, and drink less alcohol. As humans in society we 'should' be more compassionate, more tolerant, more open-minded, and less constrained by our cultural heritage. Scientists as a group would no doubt feel that they 'should' be heard by decision takers, but so would those for whom religion is important, those who are disadvantaged by poverty, or gender, or skin colour. Decision making is a political activity and politicians are notoriously unwilling to look beyond their medium term self-interest. In fact, to be honest, so are we all. 
 
 And do the public in fact want decision making to be driven by science? A recent IPSOS/Mori poll (https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Infographics/pas-2014-summary-infographic.pdf) suggests that only 55% of those surveyed felt that the benefits of science outweighed any harmful effects. Only 45% felt well informed about science. These findings in an 'advanced' western society, so what price elsewhere?
 
 There is evidence that scientific opinion is heard and understood by politicians, but action is a different matter; procrastination is a more likely outcome unless there is an immediate crisis, with potentially disadvantageous consequences, to be resolved. It seems to me that the best scientists as a whole can expect is that they will be heard as one voice amongst many competing for attention. It is important though to keep shouting or else those many for whom rationality is an unfamiliar concept may win the day.",T

 The Climate Snow Job
 A blizzard! The hottest year ever! More signs that global warming and its extreme effects are beyond debate, right? Not even close.
 
 By Patrick J. Michaels 
 Jan. 24, 2016 2:45 p.m. ET 
 An East Coast blizzard howling, global temperatures peaking, the desert Southwest flooding, drought-stricken California drying up—surely there’s a common thread tying together this “extreme” weather. There is. But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever. It is called business as usual.
 
 Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly: They’ve been going up, in fits and starts, for more than 150 years, or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age. Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up, temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II. They then cooled down a bit, only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’90s, about the same amount as earlier in the century.
 
 Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at. Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s, and since then had plateaued in a “hiatus.” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature.
 
 That changed last summer, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided to overhaul its data, throwing out satellite-sensed sea-surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on, among other sources, readings taken from the cooling-water-intake tubes of oceangoing vessels. The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship’s infrastructure conducts heat, absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun’s energy, and vessels’ intake tubes are at different ocean depths. See, for instance, John J. Kennedy’s “A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature,” published Jan. 24, 2014, by the journal Reviews of Geophysics. 
 
 NOAA’s alteration of its measurement standard and other changes produced a result that could have been predicted: a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years, erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain. Yet the increase remains far below what had been expected.
 
 It is nonetheless true that 2015 shows the highest average surface temperature in the 160-year global history since reliable records started being available, with or without the “hiatus.” But that is also not very surprising. Early in 2015, a massive El Niño broke out. These quasiperiodic reversals of Pacific trade winds and deep-ocean currents are well-documented but poorly understood. They suppress the normally massive upwelling of cold water off South America that spreads across the ocean (and is the reason that Lima may be the most pleasant equatorial city on the planet). The Pacific reversal releases massive amounts of heat, and therefore surface temperature spikes. El Niño years in a warm plateau usually set a global-temperature record. What happened this year also happened with the last big one, in 1998. 
 
 Global average surface temperature in 2015 popped up by a bit more than a quarter of a degree Fahrenheit compared with the previous year. In 1998 the temperature rose by slightly less than a quarter-degree from 1997.
 
 When the Pacific circulation returns to its more customary mode, all that suppressed cold water will surge to the surface with a vengeance, and global temperatures will drop. Temperatures in 1999 were nearly three-tenths of a degree lower than in 1998, and a similar change should occur this time around, though it might not fit so neatly into a calendar year. Often the compensatory cooling, known as La Niña, is larger than the El Niño warming.
 
 There are two real concerns about warming, neither of which has anything to do with the El Niño-enhanced recent peak. How much more is the world likely to warm as civilization continues to exhale carbon dioxide, and does warming make the weather more “extreme,” which means more costly? 
 
 Instead of relying on debatable surface-temperature information, consider instead readings in the free atmosphere (technically, the lower troposphere) taken by two independent sensors: satellite sounders and weather balloons. As has been shown repeatedly by University of Alabama climate scientist John Christy, since late 1978 (when the satellite record begins), the rate of warming in the satellite-sensed data is barely a third of what it was supposed to have been, according to the large family of global climate models now in existence. Balloon data, averaged over the four extant data sets, shows the same. 
 
 It is therefore probably prudent to cut by 50% the modeled temperature forecasts for the rest of this century. Doing so would mean that the world—without any political effort at all—won’t warm by the dreaded 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 that the United Nations regards as the climate apocalypse.
 
 The notion that world-wide weather is becoming more extreme is just that: a notion, or a testable hypothesis. As data from the world’s biggest reinsurer, Munich Re, and University of Colorado environmental-studies professor Roger Pielke Jr. have shown, weather-related losses haven’t increased at all over the past quarter-century. In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward. Last year showed the second-smallest weather-related loss of Global World Productivity, or GWP, in the entire record.
 
 Without El Niño, temperatures in 2015 would have been typical of the post-1998 regime. And, even with El Niño, the effect those temperatures had on the global economy was de minimis.

dilekdoratekin,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56c43e6122a8fb055300029c,initial_post,Assignment 2 Carbon Cycle Human Activities,0,"Carbon is vitally important for earth and life. Carbon follows a certain route on earth and this action called carbon cycle. Carbon cycle is based on carbon dioxide (CO2), which can be found in air in gaseous form and in water in dissolved form.
 Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which basically means that too much carbon dioxide in air causes the earth to warm up. Humans emit great amounts of carbon dioxide during combustion processes and because of this, the greenhouse effect consisted. The greenhouse effect means that the climate is affected by the concentrations of greenhouse gasses on earth
 Projecting climate into the future and forecating regional impacts depends on our understanding of the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans and land ecosytems
 Respiration 
 Plants (and photosynthetic algae and bacteria) then use some of the stored carbohydrates as an energy source to carry out their life functions. Some of the carbohydrates remain as biomass (the bulk of the plant, etc.). Consumers such as animals, fungi, and bacteria get their energy from this excess biomass either while living or dead and decaying. Oxygen from the atmosphere is combined with carbohydrates to liberate the stored energy. Water and carbon dioxide are byproducts. 
 oxygen + carbohydrate -> energy + water + carbohydrate 
 O2 + CH2O -> energy + H2O + CO2 
 Notice that photosynthesis and respiration are essentially the opposite of one another. Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with O2. Respiration takes O2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with CO2. However, these processes are not in balance. Not all organic matter is oxidized. Some is buried in sedimentary rocks. The result is that over geologic time, there has been more oxygen put into the atmosphere and carbon dioxide removed by photosynthesis than the reverse. 
 If CO2 concentration increases in the atmosphere because of an increased rate of outgassing, global temperature will rise. Rising temperature and more dissolved CO2 will lead to increased weathering of crustal rocks as a result of faster reaction rates (temperature effect) and greater acidity. Enhanced weathering will use up the excess CO2 thereby cooling the climate. 
 If global temperature cools as a result of some astronomical forcing or tectonic/ocean circulation effect, the lower temperatures will result in lower rates of chemical weathering. Decreased weathering means less CO2 being drawn from the atmosphere by weathering reactions, leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere to increase temperatures. 
 If more rocks become available for rapid weathering as a result of mountain uplift the enhanced weathering will draw down atmospheric CO2 and decrease global temperatures. But the decreased temperatures will slow reaction rates, thereby using less CO2, thus allowing temperatures to moderate.
  Istanbul’s off the record population is over 20 million and there are estimated 3.5 million cars. One person smokes 1499 cigarettes for one year. Burnning coals, smokestacks, exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere.
 The spesific CO2 molecules that come out of the smokestacks and exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere for only a few years on average but they don’t vanish after that time rather, they end up in other parts of the carbon cycle ( most likely absorbed in the ocean or by a plant) Other CO2 molecules are swapping places with those CO2 molecules all the time, but the total amount in the cycle is increasing because of our emissions. The question isn’t how long an individual carbon dioxide molecule stay in the atmosphere.. It is how long extra population of molecules sticks around. The answer is that is at least hundreds of years, and that’s the period when our climate will feel warming effect
 Photosynthesis, respiration and CO2 absorption/release from the ocean surfaces are all examples of natural fluxes of carbon through the Earth's systems. Human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning and deforestation, disrupt this natural flux by releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. When we mine coal and extract oil from the Earth and then burn these fossil fuels for transportation, heating, cooking, electricity and manufacturing, we are effectively moving carbon more rapidly into the atmosphere than is being removed from the atmosphere naturally through the sedimentation of carbon. This causes the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase, which leads to global warming. Also, by clear-cutting forests to support agriculture, we are transferring carbon from living biomass into the atmosphere. Because of this, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is higher than it has ever been
  Fossil fuels represent carbon storage areas. Carbon that is locked in these fossil fuels does not cycle through the Earth. When humans burn fossil fuels, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The carbon is then free to cycle through the Earth and can upset the natural balance of the carbon available, changing the way that processes occur on Earth.

As I understand the concept it is not only about having information on climate change, its causes, effects and consequences, but having an understanding sufficient to critically examine claims, assertions, speculations, and proposed responses. In other words a climate literate person is in a position to actively contribute to the ongoing debate and advocate action. It is regrettable that much discussion on this subject, apart from the scientific community, seems so far to have been ill-informed or partisan, or both.
 
 Those who are climate literate know that we are now well beyond the stage of demonstrating human culpability in global warming. The issues to be confronted now are mitigation and adaptation. Can anything be done to reduce the rate of warming and bring it to a halt sooner? Given that warming will continue in the medium term, whatever action is taken, how may human societies protect themselves from its harmful effects? These are questions upon which scientists are uniquely qualified to advise and it behoves politicians to heed their advice.
 
 In their book, Burch and Harris assert that ""Tackling the climate change challenge requires the creation of a compelling vision of a desirable future, not just recapturing a mythical past or 'tinkering around the edges' of our current development path.""

 El Niño and climate change: a great danger.
 Colombia is a country situated in the northwest of South America, bordered to the northwest by Panama; to the east by Venezuela and Brazil; to the south by Ecuador and Peru; and it shares maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Haiti.[12] It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments.
 The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and Tairona. The Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately creating the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with its capital at Bogotá
 Ecologically, Colombia is considered one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, and of these, the most biodiverse per square kilometer. Colombia is a middle power and a regional actor with the fourth largest economy in Latin America,[4] is part of the CIVETS group of six leading emerging markets and is an accessing member to the OECD.[19] Colombia has a diversified economy with macroeconomic stability and favorable growth prospects in the long run.
 Colombia is highly impacted by El Niño phenomenon; El Niño is defined by prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The U.S NOAA definition is a 3-month average warming of at least 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) in a specific area of the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean.
 Climate change has affected significantly the impact of El Niño due to the warming of the oceans, in this specific case the Pacific Ocean. Thereby, the amount of evaporation on countries like Peru makes the situation worst in countries like Colombia.
 Currently we are facing of the strongest phenomenon of El Niño seen in the climate records of Colombia. The main river has decreased in almost 2 meters dept. Cities like Bogotá are having fires in the surrounding mountains, the coast has been suffering the hardest drought in 20 years.
 The input of energy in form of heat into the ocean has changed climate cycles and has made oceans warmer (and so a larger CO2 emission). It has made the situation even worst and now regions like South America and the pacific are facing one of the strongest cycles of El Niño.
 The worst is yet to come, for the warming of the Pacific emits even more CO2 and will make incoming cycles of El Niño more powerful as in a amplifying feedback.
 In conclusion it is necessary for the governments of the Americas to deal with the current problematic the world id facing, the impact seen by the change of climate phenomenon has no precedent and will cost vast amounts of money and lives.
 The loss is biodiversity therefore is one of the main aspects we need to face, for it has no reverse. Loss of virgin forests, parts of the Amazonia and so will make and amplifying feedback due to the loss of CO2 capture and will only worsen the problem.",T

 By Viv Forbes January 19, 2016
 Those who think the political war on carbon will cool the globe or keep climate stable need to study climate history.
 Temperatures on Earth dance to a cyclic rhythm every hour, every day, every month, every season, every year, and to every beat of the sun-spot and glacial cycles.
 The daily solar cycle causes continual changes in temperature for every spot on Earth. It produces the frosts at dawn, the mid-day heat and the cooling at sunset. It is regulated by rotation of the Earth.
 Superimposed on the daily solar cycle is the monthly lunar cycle, driven by the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. These two cycles interact to produce variations in atmospheric pressure and tides, and currents in the oceans and the atmosphere. These are the daily weather makers.
 The yearly seasonal cycle is caused as the tilted axis of Earth’s rotation affects the intensity of solar energy received by each hemisphere. This produces spring, summer, autumn and winter for every spot on Earth.
 Then there is the 22 year sun-spot cycle, which correlates with cycles of floods and droughts. Sunspot cycles are indicators of solar activity which causes periods of global warming and cooling. 
 Earth’s climate is also disrupted periodically by the effects of changing winds, ocean hot spots and submarine volcanism that produce the El Nino Southern Oscillation.
 The least recognised but most dangerous climate cycle is the glacial cycle. We live in the Holocene Epoch, the latest brief warm phase of the Pleistocene Ice Age. The climate history of the Holocene, and its predecessor the Eemian, are well documented in ice core logs and other records in the rocks. Each cycle consists of a glacial age of about 80,000 years followed by a warmer age of about 20,000 years, with peak warming occurring over about 12,000 years. Our modern warm era commenced 12,000 years ago, so it is probably nearing its end.
 There have been eight warm eras separated by long glacial winters over the last 800,000 years of the Pleistocene. In every beat of this cycle, the vast ice sheets melt, sea levels rise dramatically, coral reefs and coastal settlements are drowned, and forests and animals re-colonise the higher land released from the ice. Warm climate animals such as hippos, water buffaloes and elephants got as far north as Germany in the last warm era. Then suddenly the ice returned, covering the northern hemisphere as far south as Chicago and London, destroying the forests, lowering the seas, stranding the relocated coral reefs and eliminating unprepared species. (Some dopey grizzly bears got stranded in the Arctic Ice and the most enterprising of them survived to evolve into white grizzlies now called polar bears.)
 This regular repetition of natural climate change is partially explained by the Milankovitch cycles relating to changes in Earth’s precession, orbit and tilt. These drive variations in solar energy received by Earth and have the greatest temperature effect on the large land masses of the Northern Hemisphere.
 On an even longer time scale, oscillation of the solar system through the plane of the Galaxy seems to trigger magnetic reversals and violent spasms of volcanism, crustal movements glaciation and species extinction. Earth is never still for long.
 What about the role of carbon dioxide in climate? Al Gore did a great job to dramatise the recurring glacial cycles in his widely acclaimed work of science fiction. But he missed two inconvenient truths.
 First, ice cores show that in the glacial spring-time the temperature rose BEFORE the CO2 levels rose. Therefore the rising CO2 cannot be a CAUSE of the warming – it is a RESULT of CO2 being expelled from the warming oceans.
 Second, at the top of every summer-time in the glacial cycle, the high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere were unable to prevent the cooling into the next cycle of ice.
 We are already in the autumn of the current glacial cycle and nothing man can do will change that. Global temperatures today are lower than they were in Roman and Medieval times. They will still fluctuate with the effects of daily, lunar, yearly and sun-spot cycles, but the long-term trend of maximum and minimum temperatures will continue drifting downwards. Once summer temperatures in places like Siberia are unable to melt last winter’s snow, the already growing glaciers will join to form ice sheets and Earth will once again be gripped by another long Glacial Winter.
 The transition from Greenhouse Earth to Icehouse Earth always occurs suddenly. Once our verdant greenhouse is gone, life of Earth will never be the same again.
 The warm days, seasons, years and epochs have never been a deadly threat to life on Earth. Frost, snow, hail and ice are the killers. If our descendants do not have the energy, resources and wisdom to keep their people warm and fed through the coming glacial epoch, humans may follow our Neanderthal cousins who perished in the last glacial winter, just 20,000 years ago.
 It is a wonder of the modern era that people who cannot accurately forecast next weekend’s weather claim they can regulate the temperature of the whole globe by bashing industry and taxing carbon.
 There is NO evidence in climate history that carbon dioxide has a detectable effect on global temperatures. However if our continued use of cheap reliable hydro-carbon energy does slightly delay the onset of the next glacial winter, we and all life on Earth should count ourselves extremely lucky.

timothyabrown,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56bc272d2d96fe050a000890,initial_post,Which greenhouse gas is causing the most damage,3,"I'd really like to get to the bottom of this before the course end. Perhaps the moderators can provide some input.
 
 The following links state that methane traps 100 times more heat in the atmosphere than CO2 within a 5 year period and 72 times more within a 20 year period. However methane leaves the atmosphere within a decade. So, it works out to be about 20 times more potent than CO2 over a 100 year period.
 
 However, it seems that we need to act now to prevent climate change and so the 20 year period with a 72 times potency is more pertinent.
 
 If correct, the bottom line of these statistics is that methane presents much more of a problem than CO2. http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/
 
 But what is creating the most Methane, industry or animal agriculture. The following two sites contradict each other. http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html, says that industry in the USA is the largest source of methane. Whilst the emissions flow chart on this site http://www.skepticalscience.com/animal-agriculture-meat-global-warming.htm, says that agriculture is the largest source of methane.
 
 So, my question is, which is the worst greenhouse gas, and what is mostly creating that gas?

 I'm confused. The answer marked correct for the 'peaks' and 'troughs' occurring in which season (northern hemisphere) is Peak: Spring, Trough: Fall.
 
 However I thought:
 
 ""There's enough CO2 moving in and out of plants this way that the level of atmospheric CO2 drops every year during the northern spring (when plant growth and photosynthesis are at a max globally) and increases during autumn as photosynthesis drops right back. It's like watching the planet take its annual breath.""
 
 Wouldn't this put the CO2 level troughs in spring and the peaks in autumn (fall)?",T

  - Construct one amplifying feedback loop that has nothing to do with climate;
  - Construct one stabilizing feedback loop that has nothing to do with climate;
  - Share your feedback loops on the discussion forum and check out others’ (*Either add your post on the [Module 2 Discussions page][1], or look for a pinned thread near the top of the list in the main ""Discussion"" area so these contributions can stay together*) . Are they really feedback loops? A word of warning: the most common errors people make in trying to construct feedback loops are: (1) illogical steps which don’t follow from what happened previously in the loop (“It started to rain, then there was a meteor impact…”); (2) failure to loop back around to the start, i.e. constructing just a cause-and-effect chain of events (“I walked through a puddle, so my feet got wet”). Feedback loops have to “feed back”.

They believe what they read in the media, hear from our politicians and see in their direct surrounding.

 we talk about adaptation and mitigation processes to lead climate change, but in our region need to make many changes of human consciousness, the impact that we as a developing country, we are catastrophic, starting with the simple fact that our water budget does not match the accounting of it, and in the aspect of quality have much to learn.
 in my country we have to make changes in our habits of public hygiene, beginning with the national and sub-national authorities, not fooled by this global issue such as climate change and its consequences for the future, I think there lies our problem, we do not plan for the future, if not for this next, so in general there is no point of congruence to benefit the majority.
 
 we can not talk about climate change and its consequences, if we have failed to educate the population in relation to the culture of caring for nature, to care for all that gives us culture by the water, if you become aware of the importance of taking care of our ecosystems.
 through you we are requesting help, we do functions that you did 60 or 70 years ago
 our situation is uncertain, worrying as it is not where to begin to become aware of the problem which we are, and that has not reached its climax.
 in the course, I was informed that the greenhouse gas effect is the same as a country with high population densities, such as low density.
 overall we are doing things not as developed countries formulated, is not known but they are doing our authorities on the issue.
 we have no right to water quantity and quality, which is the first step towards public hygiene, we will be thinking the adaptation to climate change in the next 30 years, the mitigation end of the 21st century, not masters of our needs are others, and that with this event we could get from the international community the necessary conditions for a society to think of sustainable development, such as public health.
 sorry if my test is not what you ask, but I repeat I am extremely concerned about the event that we are living, and we well thanks on the issue.

  - (2) If you want to read-up on forum content since you last visited, select “Unread” from this drop-down to narrow down the posts displayed:
 
 ![enter image description here][3]
 
 > Note: if you want to refresh the list of displayed posts, toggle
 > between “Show all” and “Unread” in the drop-down - do not refresh the
 > page via your browser as this will reset the main selection to “All
 > Discussions” and you’ll need to switch this back manually to the view
 > you were in.
 
  - (3) The third drop-down can be used to determine the sort-order with “recent activity” most likely being the most helpful one. Posts created or replied to recently will show up at the top of the list then:
 
 ![enter image description here][4]
 
 **How to know what might have changed**
 
 If the number is white on blue, it means that the post was created new since you last visited:
 
 ![enter image description here][5]
 
 If the number is black on white, a response or comment was added to a post (or some other update happened, like editing a comment)
 
 ![enter image description here][6]
 
 If the number is black on grey, then your response or comment was the last one added or there was no new activity at all.
 
 ![enter image description here][7]
 
 **Check out pinned forum posts**
 
 Some forum posts - usually created by Community TAs or Staff - have been pinned to the top in order to make them “stand out” and be easily accessible. Make sure to check them out as they contain important information!
 
 ![enter image description here][8]
 
 **Finding new content in long threads**
 
 In some posts with many responses and comments it can be difficult to locate new content via scrolling through it. What you can then do is to use your browser’s search function by hitting CTRL+F. In Firefox a search box will be displayed e.g. at the bottom of the window: 
 
 ![enter image description here][9]
 
 Depending on how long ago you last checked a post, you can now search for “hour”, “minute” or “day” to find recent updates.
 
 ![enter image description here][10]
 
 **Looking for posts with specific content**
 
 You can use the search box to see if others have already posted about something you’d like to discuss:
 
 ![enter image description here][11]
 
 You can also look for posts by one of your coursemates by entering her/his username:
 
 ![enter image description here][12]
 
 If you click on the highlighted bar, you’ll end up at the overview page listing all posts and comments by the student.
 
 **Follow links from posts with the CTRL-key clicked**
 If you just click on a link within a forum-post, the page will be opened in the same tab. If you then use the back-function to go back to the forum-post, the edX platform always does a page refresh which loses any restrictions you may have had set previously via the drop-downs and revert back to “All discussions” and “Show All”.
 
 **Creating a new post (edX-lingo for thread)**
 
 ![enter image description here][13]
 
  - (1) Click on the “New Post” button from any forum page; 
  - (2) decide if it’s going to be a question or discussion; 
  - (3) select the relevant sub-forum via the “TOPIC AREA” list; 
  - (4) give your post a meaningful title; 
  - (5) as you add your post, remember that you can add text formatting, pictures, links, quoteboxes, etc. to enrich your content; and 
  - (6) finish by clicking “add post”.
 
 **Options available for a post**
 
 The options available depend on whether it’s your own or a coursemate’s post, but you have up to three options available:
 
 ![enter image description here][14]
 
 You can upvote a post or response a coursemate posted by clicking on “+”. You can decide to follow a post by clicking on “*”. What you see for the more-menu “...” depends on whether it’s your own post or not.
 
 ![enter image description here][15]
 
 If you discover typos or similar issues with your own post, response or comment, you can correct it by selecting “Edit” from the more-menue.
 If the post doesn’t follow the forum guidelines you can report it. Unfortunately, this sets a flag but doesn’t tell us why it was reported as the edX-forums don’t yet have a means via which you can add a comment only visible to staff explaining why you flagged something.
 
 Hope this helps!

Akatombo,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56bb41f9af36f305000007ff,initial_post,May I put my assignment here?,1,"Assignment 2
 I couldn't find out enough document, I'll expand this region.
 I live at Himeji city in Kansai area. Around here we didn't enough water to grow rice , so people made many artificial ponds. According to a regional history Himeji clan mede Kako ouike in 1638. This is the first pond in written history. When I checked the number of ponds, I found Hyougo pre. is the top. (43,321). The second is Hiroshima (20,183)(200km away from Himeji by strech). The third is Kagawa in Shikoku island (14,619).(80 km from Himeji). So that I can say these three are almost same area. 
 My point around climate change is that recently we got a rain in one day so much. I think this is a very document why people who lived in this area made so many ponds.In this area they didn't get enough water to grow rice. So they needed to make artificial ponds.
  19,Aug. through 20 Aug. 2016 a warm front was keeping on Japan Sea, warm and moistured air flow into it, air was very unstable in Hiroshima pre. At night it rained 101.0 mm in one hour. 217.0 mm in three hours,257.0 mm in 24 hours.This was the worst report in Hiroshima.This caused big landslide disaster which killed 18 people, serious damage 3 people. Not only people it claimed much on their properties and cars. 
  When I see a graph of average rain fall in Hiroshima, it's 1537.6 mm. They don't have much rain in winter less than 70 mm (Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb.) But during spring and summer each month they have 100-200 mm. So I found 257 mm is the worst document in a day. They have the average of rainfall in a year 1537.6 mm. (1981-2010)
 Next example is from Kouchi where is next to Kagawa pre. Why I chose here? Because I have a big impression about here.The top of the rainfall list is 867.0 mm in a day. (19,July,2011) The second is 606.5 mm.(5,Aug.2014) This became 1186.0 mm in three days. The third is 674.0 mm (10,Aug. 2014) This became 918.5 mm in three days. That is to say nearly 1 m depth rainfall in three days. Could you believe it? They have average of rainfall 2547.5 mm in a year. (the average of 30 years 1981-2010). Kouchi is the top of the rainfall list in a year.
 Let's go back to Tame-ike. I found Tame-ike itself become a cause of a disaster when we have such amount of rainfall. And in case of heavy rainfall, it comes with typhoon. Not only typhoon itself become stronger than before, but also heavy rain and strong wind give us a huge damage.
 When I was child, strong typhoon was about 950-960 hPs.Nowadays we can have a typhoon less than 900hPs. It's incredible for me. I can't imagin its'strength. Resercher said that because of El Nino. It's one of the famous climate change.
 El Nino causes everything,resercher says.El Nino and La Nino means more extream weather grobaly. We just know where the events may happen.Because of these, we can say grobal warming is clear. In the El Nino sea water become warmer year by year.Then they make much water vapor. Water vapor is the top of greenhouse gases. The energy trapped by water vapor is shown southern to northern latitude, peaking near the equater. Water vapor trap alot of energy.( 1.8 Farebheite means water vapor trap extra 2 watts of energy.)
  These secondary changes are called climate feedback and they could be more than double the amount of warming caused by carbon dioxcide alone. Average residence time of water vapor molecule is 9 days. If greengas concentrations stabilized today,the planet would continue to warm about 0.6'c over next century. 
 Another reason to make sea water warm is maybe because of nuclear power plants.After 2011 Tohoku Disaster all nuclear power plant stopped in Japan.In this time assistant professor checked sea water temprature near the Fukui pre.He found the temperature around them came back normal. It means sea water became 2'C cooler before the disaster. He said because of 2'C difference made impact on sea creatures and sea plants.

MaddySloan,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/1T2016,56abce472d96fe04da00001d,initial_post,Missed upload area for Assignment 1,5,"I uploaded my essay to the map on January 25, after following the directions. After completing Module 3, I logged back in to figure out how to start my peer reviews... then saw that apparently I was supposed to upload my essay in TWO places?! 
 I am hoping I can still continue, as I am very much enjoying this course, and I did after all submit my essay on time. 
 The steps were not clear, and even though I use the arrows buttons on the bottom of the pages to navigate, I swear I never saw the step about uploading it elsewhere, just the map. There was a *note at the bottom, but I missed that one too somehow, probably because I was concentrating on the map upload, and thought it was just about technical stuff. 
 I have noticed it is very hard to tell which ""page"" you are on, and I usually look through each module quickly before I start it. I have to ensure that I am on the ""first"" page of that lesson, as the edX system keeps you on the last page (which is normally fine if you are just going in order). It was very confusing for a while, and I think this is what happened with Assignment 1 Instructions - when I clicked on it, it took me to the last page, stating to upload it to the map, missing the pages about the peer review upload. 
 I hope that I can still get my essay reviewed and receive a mark. 
 I suggest a change in these directions to make it more clear. Had that note been in bold and large text saying: REMINDER - MUST UPLOAD in TWO PLACES, I'm positive I wouldn't have missed it, and then figured out I needed to go back pages to find the instructions. They should all be on one page, not spread out. 
 Again, it was uploaded early, on January 25. 
 What is the point of the map upload at all? Why not have it simply link to your profile (which is on the map) instead of the dual upload?",a

This CO2 will lower the pH of one's bloodstream and will trigger an increase in breathing rate. There are chemoreceptors in the body which force you to breathe after a certain period of time. We then exhale CO2, which in turn lowers the amount in the bloodstream, returning it to a normal, stabilized level. Most physiological changes in the body follow a ""stabilizing"" pattern.
 
 Amplifying: (1) If you were to cut a major artery, like the femoral or carotid, your body's barorecepors (pressure) would detect a loss of blood pressure. Trying to keep the brain well supplied with blood, its response would be to have the heart pump faster and harder - causing you to bleed to death faster.
 
 Or (2) our psychological/physiological response to narcotic pain killers. People who take Norco/Codeine/Oxycontin will experience a need for a higher dosage over time to achieve the same results. Receptors in the brain decrease in number as the system is flooded with these artificial opiates. Since there are fewer receptors, we need more of the opiate to achieve the same level of pain relief. So even with more Norco, we experience more pain, so we take more, and it becomes even less effective.",t

 South East Florida, composed of Monroe, Miami-Dade and Broward County, home of iconic cities and landscapes such as Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and the Palm Beaches, rests on the lower tip of the Floridian Peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The unique position of the peninsula and distinct geological features make the area susceptible to economic, social and environmental stress caused by increased vulnerability to risks linked to Climate Change (CC). Some possible cc risks include increased vulnerability to sea level rise, salt water intrusion, vulnerability to extreme events (hurricanes and other storms), and vulnerability to public health hazards like the encroachment of subtropical mosquito-transmitted diseases like Dengue and the Zitca virus.[1] Though the region faces similar cc risks, the challenges facing each area is unique, therefore this essay will focus on issues in Miami Dade County (MDC) and flooding risks caused by sea level rise. 
 Research predicts that one of the consequences of climate change include rising sea levels (SLR). As covered in the course, climate change is being driven by an imbalance of energy whereby the energy entering the earth is not balanced with energy reflected back to space, causing increased stocks of energy, present in the form of heat, on the earth’s surface. An increased stock of greenhouse gases, believed to be linked to anthropogenic emissions, creates a greenhouse effect that contributes to amplifying feedback loops leading to temperature increases. Temperature increases increase rate of organic decay, melting of ice sheets, warmer currents accelerating ice melt and decreasing permafrost, to name a few. On a global scale, the increased stock of energy is causing temperature increases, which in turn affected hydrological systems, including, what the IPCC identifies with ‘very high confidence’ as a projected sea level rise “through the 21st century and beyond [where], coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion.[2] The same report projects that risks will increase as temperatures increase and that an increase above 3C could lead to ‘irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss’ of up to 7meters.[3]
 MDC is particularly susceptible to sea level rise due to its unique geographical and geological position. In South East Florida and MDC, specifically, recent area specific studies by NOAA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published by the South East Florida Climate Compact project that sea level could increase by 6-10 inches by 2030, 14-26 inches by 2060, and 31-61 inches by 2100 (above 1992 average sea levels).[4] A slowing of the Florida Current and Gulf Stream could also amplify regional sea level rise affecting Miami Dade County.[4] Because most of MDC is at or just above sea level, there is increased risk of permanent displacement of flooding damages caused by rising sea levels. An increased stock of water coming from the ocean can decrease the land’s ability to absorb water when precipitation occurs because water will be at sea level and less likely to follow current patterns back to the ocean. Flooding can also occur during precipitation, when increased stock of water is more likely to saturate land, less likely to be absorbed and collect, causing flooding. In addition to property damage, flooding can cause other potential problems include damage to key infrastructure such as utilities (water, electricity, and sewage) and infrastructure such as roads and bridges. According to recent studies, four meters in sea level rise is enough to cover all MDC underwater and the highest projected sea level rise of 61 inches by 2100 is estimated to flood 40% of the county.[5] If 40% of the area is flooded by sea there are secondary issues caused by an increased stock of displaced people. In other words, people living on the shoreline will no longer be able to live in areas that become permanently covered in water and will have to move further inland thus increasing demand for space. This could be an amplifying effect because an increased demand for space could lead to increased incursion into the everglades, increasing emissions and increasing area covered by less permeable surfaces such as housing and asphalt. 
 
 In conclusion, here is ample evidence that climate change is causing sea levels to rise. Rising sea levels increase risk of flooding in low lying areas close to shorelines where sea level rise is projected to cause flooding.

Did global warming contribute to these extreme conditions in Texas?
  According to John Nielson-Gammon, Professor of Climatology at Texas A&M University, extreme weather events and their frequency are among the most agreed-upon effects of global warming in all the scientific literature on the subject.(2) Nielson-Gammon said that the ending of a drought by sudden heavy rains has happened three times in the last 100 years in Texas. Experts said that things were different this time because of climate change. Warmer temperatures have exacerbated evaporation on land and pushed more water into the atmosphere which lead to heavier rainfall. (3) Brenda Ekwurzel, a senior climate scientist at the science advocacy group, Union of Concerned Scientist, believes that global warming contributed to these extreme conditions. She said that the burgeoning of El Nino and the record breaking ocean surface temperatures in April, 2015, likely revved up the hydrological cycle in Texas. The warmer atmosphere has the capability to hold more water vapor and when storms organize, more water can be wrung out of the atmosphere than in the past. Katharine Hayhoe, director of Texas Tech State University’s Climate Science Center says that extreme weather events,such as droughts and floods occur naturally in Texas, and that climate change is not causing these extreme events; but climate change exacerbates these weather extremes, causing them to be worse than they would have been naturally.(4)
 The National Drought Mitigation Center created a chart describing drought conditions in Texas from January 20, 2015 to January 19. 2016. On January 20, 2015, 39.80% of the state was considered not to be in a drought condition. On January 19, 2016, 98.31% of the state was not in a drought condition.(5)
 The ending of a drought is a normal event, but the ending of a record breaking drought in a matter of weeks is not a normal event. NOAA compiled precipitation data for a section of the northern part of Texas where two major cities (Dallas and Ft. Worth) are located. The normal annual rainfall for the region is approximately 34 inches. The annual rainfall for 2015 was 62.61 inches – 82% greater than normal. The aggregate for April, May and June in 2015 was around 26 inches with May having the largest amount of rainfall – 16.96 inches.(6)
 In Central Texas located just out of the City of Austin is Lake Travis, a large reservoir that provides water for Austin and the surrounding area. The lake covers 18,929 acres and has a capacity of 1,953,936 acre-feet. At the end of April, 2015, the water level was at 629.38 feet of water. On May 19, 2015 the water level stood at 633.56 feet and on May 26, 2015, the water level was 655.52 feet. This data shows that the lake level rose nearly 22 feet in seven days and 26 feet in about a month.(7)
 About 60 miles south of Austin is the town of Wimberley and the Concho River traverses the town. On May 25, 2015 a major rain event occurred. In a period of 4 hours 5.97 inches of rain fell. On the following day the river rose more than 33 feet in just 3 hours, cresting at 27 feet above flood stage. At this point an all- time record crest was broken by 7 feet. It is important to know that at this point during the flood, the flood gauge stopped reporting data as the water continued to rise.(8)
 The City of Houston, the largest city in Texas, is located just off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. On May 27, 2015, the city received more than 10 inches of rainfall in a 24 hour period causing extensive flooding.(9)
 Extreme weather events as those discussed above are normal in Texas, but the intensity of these events is well above normal and average as the data has shown. Couple the data presented here with the extremely large geographic area that these conditions covered and a case for the influence of climate change on Texas weather can be seen.

 (1) I am 100% for enforcing a CFC ban across the globe. There are alternatives that also work, which do not deplete the ozone layer. No ozone means UV rays get through more easily, and skin cancer abounds. Not to mention life on land could not exist without the ozone layer's protection. The aerosols make it to the upper atmosphere, and affect everyone (especially those at the poles). [Montreal protocol]
 
 (2) Tetraethyl Lead in gasoline. 80% for a global ban. It does not affect me. Those populations where lead is used with have higher rates of lead-related illness. Since it does not affect me, and I am less concerned about it.
 
 (3) DDT elimination [Stockholm Convention] 80% for a global ban. It has been banned for agricultural use, but some can use it for malarial relief. More localized, and the effects in Sub-Saharan Africa don't affect me. I am less concerned.
 
 (4) AGW/Ocean Acidification: 50% for global carbon tax. It affects everyone, like CFCs. But our societies are built around petroleum. Trucking, autos, heating, cooling. I have seen estimates around $47 trillion dollars to revamp power grids and transportation around renewable sources of energy.
 
 In addition to the costs associated, there is a real question about the feasibility of weaning everyone off of carbon. China needs to commit. India needs to commit. The U.S. has 4% of the world's population. We have been the leaders in climate science, and in the funding of all things climate related. But this problem is too big for us, and I don't think many countries can contribute much to the cause. Even the EU is having its issues.

  I couldn’t find out how to make model. So I’ll check the nuclear power plants. It looks to predict easily what is going to impact on climate change.
 As you know, it’s the wonderful power energy without co2 in the air. At least it was believed in Japan by the 11th, March 2011. 
 
 After huge disaster in Fukushima nuclear power plants exploded, we began to know what happened and how we were stupid. So in this model, I checked 
 Nuclear tests, and how many nuclear power plants we have in the past few decades. Then I’ll predict how it’ll be going on.
 
  At first I checked how many times nuclear tests was repeated in the world.
 We, Japanese, had a nuclear bomb in 1945. That was the first time to use nuclear power as bomb. First Hiroshima then Nagasaki. When we read and watch documents about those, everybody said they saw mushroom cloud and 
 strong heats. Even now we saw a shadow of humane on the stair belonged building. They said a humane body became a carbonized. It was summer. So many Japanese women wore kimono (called yukata ) and pants ( also called monpe). If yukata had a dark color, it’s pattern was printed on human’s skin.
 Or many people couldn’t feel at all although their skin was hanging from their arms and faces. We saw the same situation very recent in Syria.
 
  Whenever nuclear bomb explodes, a center of the fireball reach a million degrees Celsius, and surface of ground gets to 3000-5000 degrees Celsius.
 
 In last decades many countries tried nuclear tests.
  America--- 1013 times (both nuclear bomb hydrogen bomb)
  Russia------715 times ( also both)
  England----45 times
  France-------210 times
  China--------45 times
  India---------- 2 times
  Pakistan----- 6 times
  North Korea—5 times 
  South Africa and Israel ----1
  Surprisingly some of them were tested in other countries or far away from their own country like Australia, Algeria, Polynesia and Bikini Islands. 
 I thought these tests had effected on sea water temperature.
 But these tests were stopped after the Limited Ban Treaty in 1963. It was ratified only 3 countries ( America, Russia, England ), then 118. Lastly another treat was ratified in 1996 but it didn’t no effect in 2012. 
 
 Next I’ll talk about nuclear power plants. 
 Nowadays many countries have nuclear power plants. But after Three Mile Islands disaster, Chernobyl , and Fukushima disaster, many countries changed their mind. Germany and Sweden had already decided to stop their power plants a few years later. How I shamed Japanese government changed their tactics on nuclear power plants. They decided to reuse them and expanded using time from 40 to 60 years.

 When we use nuclear power plants, we should always use water to cool down its water vapor. Because of this nuclear power plants are constructed near a river and sea. In case of Japan if a million kw nuclear power plant worked, its heat could boil 150L bath for ten thousands family at instantly. So we should cool down this water. A researcher checked this many times. He said
 the temperature in sea around a nuclear power plant went up to 2 Celsius degrees . The difference of 2’C brought totally different creatures. Once familiar creatures had gone, new creatures appeared. After Fukushima disaster all new clear power plants stopped, then the temperature went down. New spices went out and familiar creatures came back.
 
 Water vapor generates electricity, at the same time it make new water vapor in the sea. It effect on enormous weather. We made a bad circuit.",t

So far I've come across concepts of soil respiration and organisms like myccorhizal fungi that play a critical role in moving carbon and other elements between decaying matter and plants. I'm sure that more will emerge in understanding this dynamic concern of soil as a living system and how it contributes to balancing stocks and flows of carbon dioxide, water and other life forming molecules.

I am a Roman Catholic and am a believer in the gospel. As someone who believes that this beautiful world is a gift to us from God, I believe that we must protect it. In my intro, I noted that I was once a climate change skeptic or agnostic (not a denier). However, even at that time, I believed very strongly in the responsibility that we all have to protect God's creation as it was given to us. I know this may not be a motivation for many on here, but it is a guilding purpose for me in how I try to live my life.
 
 However, it is also frustrating. I am only one person. I can influence my own behavior and I can try to teach others. However, we need much more. I typically commute by bicycle (not only cleaner but also good triathlon training). However, it commonly see highly polluting vehicles (especially old motor scooters) on the road leaving big clouds of smoke behind them. How frustrating is that? Even after the wind blows the dirty air away, the actions of people that I have no control over simply re-creates the poor air situation, which also exacerbates the carbon problem.
 
 Give up? I can't. We can't. I have my daughter to think of. That is also a part of the spiritual aspect: our progeny. We all need to do what we can, regardless of what our personal motivation is. We are all on the same team... sharing the same planet.",t

 The more Syria is bombed and its civilian population is massacred and left without food, medicine and shelter, the more Syrian war refugees seek to save their lives by immigrating . Thus, war is what caused the immigration in the first place, and also war is what accelerates the rate and the extent of the immigration of the Syrian population. War acts as an amplifying feedback loop by increasing the number of war refugees.
 
 
 **Amplifying feedback loop**
 Greece has signed the Shenghen Agreement. This means that it has stopped exercising border controls. Being the first EU country member in the eastern part of Europe makes it a desired destination for refugees in their way to central or western European countries.
 Greek Aegean islanders are very hospitable people. They risk their lives to save war refugees from Syria when their boats sink. Then they do their best to help them. This warmth, combined with the fact that there are no border controls in Greece, has created an amplifying feedback loop: More refugees keep coming to Greece as time goes by, even though many of them do not reach the Greek shores alive. 
 
 **A stabilizing feedback loop**
 If the war in Syria ends and if food, water, medical care, and shelter are provided to its starving population, then less Syrians will seek asylum. 
 
 **A stabilizing feedback loop**
 If Greece leaves the Schengen Agreement and reinstalls border controls, then refugees will be deterred from coming to Europe via Greece. They would rather travel by land: from Turkey to Bulgaria. Τhus, they would not drown in the Aegean Sea. Border controls would act as a stabilizing feedback loop for Greece, a small country which has been hit by the worst recession since world war II, and which cannot cope with hundreds of thousands of war refugees.",t

 The summit of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, where diplomats, politicians, scientists, journalists and representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 179 countries they came together in a plural effort to establish a synergy between human socioeconomic activities on the environment and vice versa, and international action based on the liability of the environment and the economy were established.
 From the late '80s, depletion of economic models and social organization, poverty and social inequality, joined other issues that had not had much to talk about before, I mean environmental guidelines and environmental to achieve sustainable and equitable growth for the next years.
 The great environmental impact relating to the increase in industrial production based on the extraction of natural resources to increase the wealth and overcome the effects of poverty and marginalization (eg) ecosystem damage was analyzed.
 Making an evaluative analysis of sustainability in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1992, it has potentially large dynamic participatory by countries and civil society. In purely economic terms, the 80s was a deep dive into economic reforms centered on trade liberalization and capital flows with the foreign market, it was not until the early 90s when production activity grew and slowly recovering. The social situation in Latin America and the Caribbean in the 90s was a progressive demographic transition and aging population, poor job creation, a negligible reduction in poverty and a wild increase in social inequality. As for the environmental sector, not pipe pollution abandon, on the contrary, the pollution of water, soil and air is increased due to an unplanned and over-harvesting (UNEP, 2000) urbanization.
 Environmental regulatory frameworks took weight through an evolutionary process from the Rio Summit in 1992 to date (UNDP, 1999), making significant progress and importance in environmental impact assessments, rate of pollutants, land management, new offenses and legal responsibilities to environmental offenses. The summit also marked a historic precedent in the agreements between nations in comprehensive issues of national and global environmental issues, having a vision of broad and ambitious sustainable development, consolidating a universal political response with full cooperative environmental dimensions.
 From the Stockholm Conference, which opened a prelude to the celebration of the Rio summit, the perception of a global environmental crisis is an inexorably changed. That technocratic vision of the problems, in which case would be solved by themselves to scientific development for sustainable development, it was only a fleeting dream, where there is no room for environment and development as a preemption or inequality of a concept to another, since the former is merely the failure of the second, this means that environmental issues are just the problems of development.
 One of the many problems that exist at present and whose perception can be understood as a challenge on the road to Johannesburg is globalization. Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, states:
 The past decade reveals how millions of people around the world have been experiencing globalization not as an agent of progress but as a disruptive and even destructive force, while many millions more have been absolutely excluded from its benefits ... Globalization has been seen by many to be inevitable. While its main engine is technology and the expansion and integration of markets, it is also correct to note that globalization is not a ""force of nature"", but the result of human-driven processes. It is at that precise meaning to be tame for the service of humanity. To do this, it needs to be carefully managed, nationally, by sovereign countries, and internationally, through cooperation. (Grunberg and Khan 2000).
 Talked about environmental policies and institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean since the Rio Summit in 1992, we will begin to differentiate sustainable development with environmental management, although the former requires the second is not the same. In the dream towards ecological sustainability for Latino and Caribbean, it is true that environmental management has evolved considerably with the creation of laws, regulations environmental policies, institution, etc., even the facts demonstrate devastas ecology, which increases continuously, but why is this possible if there is a broad legal framework? While the legislation is adequate, although advances in the field have not been enough to stop the inertial exploitation of natural resources to acquire wealth, coupled with exaggerated demand and consumption.
 We distinguish between the main developments after the Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1992) in environmental management consecration of an environmental Constitution, creating new environmental standards and upgrade existing ones, policy with senior environmental, expanding environmental agenda related to the agreements reached at the Rio summit, the creation of environmental ministries and councils, environmental impact assessments, progress in land management, introducing new economic instruments and introduction of new management tools , among others.
 After Rio, government representatives from Latin America and the Caribbean took a language of sustainable development in official documents. However, in many countries it has only taken a symbolic value, since in recent decades, environmental issues in fundamental and sectoral policies is a very shy topic as wrongly governments face this issue by relying on the belief that it is a limitation development and therefore, as a matter of low priority at the time of combining strategies aimed at overall economic development.
 
 Increased social participation in decisions that affect a healthy environment has grown exponentially because all countries incorporate mechanisms that integrate people into a sustainable perspective, doing more democratic Latin American societies, which has brought modernization and genuineness of ancestral authoritarianism. This movement, which emerged after the Rio summit, thousands of NGOs were open endless possibilities for social participation, creating national and international networks of technical and financial support for environmental causes. From this context, one can say that participation and strengthening civil society is the means for creating political will. An important issue discussed during the Rio Summit was Sustainable Consumption, identified as a key challenge to achieve sustainable development, because the consumer is a potential threat to the environment, polluting the air, rivers, lakes, seas and soils , leading to the inevitable destruction of ecosystems, reducing the quality of visa worldwide. Symposium Oslo in 1994 and adopted by the third session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD III) in 1995 states that sustainable consumption is: Use of goods and services that respond to basic needs and provide a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources, toxic materials and emissions of waste and pollutants throughout the life cycle, so that does not jeopardize the needs of future generations. Agenda 21 and the United Nations Recommendations for the Protection of the consumer, identify themselves as government obligations, minimizing the use of resources, promote government leadership and reinforce the values, all these issues related to consumer product a sustainable vision. Making an analysis in Mexico regarding the policies of ""sustainability"" and its development trends, we can say that as a country has undertaken many actions and trends that put it on par with other countries in Latin America. Mexico has a secretariat devoted entirely to environmental issues (Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, SEMARNAT), has designed and promoted laws, regulations and standards, as well as projects and environmental management programs.
 
 Environmental education is a vital player to sustainable development, according to SEDEMA, environmental education is a training process that allows awareness of the importance of the environment, promotes the development of citizenship values and new attitudes that contribute the rational use of natural resources and solving environmental problems we face in our city. Environmental education is a milestone in the global meeting in Stockholm in 1972, where one hundred three member states of the United Nations and more than four NGOs implemented a program related to the knowledge of the environment for the improvement and development of natural resources the present and future generations. The UNEP launched an International Programme for Environmental Education, a fundamental fact which opened doors to regions of Latin America and the Caribbean to implement a model of ""eco"", which was launched from strategic locations; institutions, communities and schools. In terms of human mobility, the studies are not very specific, however, migration studies should include a dimension in which the historical relationship between man and nature is related. The term of population mobility impacts directly to environmental change, including urbanization, shifts back and forth and tourism, which can change the perspective of the relationship between native peoples and their ancestral and cultural relationship with nature. Mobility (or migration) involves many environmental, social, political and economic changes.
 In the framework of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, adopted in Rio in 1992, the harmful effects of greenhouse gases (GHG) were established, so that climate change and energy development were key points during this summit. It was established that the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere damage the global climate system, so that the Kyoto Protocol was established in 1977, settling in the tools needed to reduce GHG emissions on a global scale. Despite setting the established responsibilities in the Kyoto Protocol, Latin America as part of the developing world has contributed very little to the contribution against climate change, measured in terms of GHG, and despite the lack of responsibility of developing countries, unfortunately they are more likely to suffer the effects of climate change because of their greater vulnerability. CO2 emissions, a greenhouse gas, from the burning of fossil fuels globally, increased from 14.7 gigatonnes (Gt) in 1971 to 21.3 Gt by 1990. From 1990 to 1999 the increase amounted to 23.2 Gt. In Latin America these figures are disturbing, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have risen by 33% from 1990 to 1999, while emissions in the United States have grown only 15% during that period. The key indicators for the control of emissions of carbon dioxide from 1990 to 2100 are; to population density, gross domestic product, the intensity of energy consumption, the rate of carbonization of the energy sector and carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector.
 Global climate change a very serious problem in many countries, including those belonging to the American continent faced. Research related to this phenomenon and can demonstrate the man's hand as an important contribution of this phenomenon, mainly led to the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere factor, which causes overheating of the earth's surface, the responsibility of problem is very clear, since 90% of greenhouse gases come from industrialized countries (Smith, 1991), but regions like Latin America contributes globally to only 4% of total GHG emissions, in addition to all its emissions historical have been much lower than that of industrialized countries. Most greenhouse gases are caused heavy deforestation of forests for agriculture and the timber industry. In a study to Mexico, if concentrations of CO2, about 70% of the land area and its forests are duplicated would be severely affected (Villers and Trejo-Vázquez, 1998).
 Analyzing the case of forests in Mexico, even though these are killed for holding, it is estimated that even 69% of the land area (135.1 million hectares) is covered by natural vegetation, of which 42,700,000 ha are forested (SEMARNAP, 2000), from a viewpoint of biodiversity, Mexican forest ecosystems are unparalleled worldwide bilógico resort, however in recent years, deforestation in Mexico has been a very strong problem especially rural zones.
 According to the newspaper Forest Inventory (1994), Mexico has about 53 million native forests, of which 40% are regulated use, this percentage, about 71% of this area belongs to ejidos, 14% is held communally and 15% of small private properties (SEMARNAP, 1994). In the 90 timber production associated with these areas of forests increased from 7.4 to 8.5 million m3 reported in 1999. Throughout 1990 and 2000, the trade balance went from $ 649 to 1.700 million (SEMARNAT / CONAFORE 2001 ).
 
 Most alterations to the planet, was reflected in the second half of the twentieth century, this was a time when there was a great impact on the loss of natural ecosystems and environmental services demanded of them, including forests. The causes are linked to various phenomena, including demographic, productive, environmental, economic, commercial, social, cultural and political issues, all related to a lack of planning with a sustainable vision, generating severe impacts on nature, in Latin America, including Mexico, have lost more than a third of terrestrial natural ecosystems, however it is the region which has more closed and most biodiverse forests. Within the productive effects, agriculture, covering a large section of the regions of felled timber is, so it is proposed globally, an agro-ecological perspective to maintain an environmentally sound agriculture and socially just in Latin America, affecting main positive way small farmers living in marginal environments, but may produce a lot of food sovereignty required for food, based on new technological approaches and supports local governments and NGOs to establish a food security at household level, regional and national levels.
 
 The situation of agriculture in Latin America, from the Rio Summit has worsened; 73 million of the 123 million people living in rural areas still live in poverty, and farmers remain marginalized by advances in technology, such as in Mexico, less than 12% of farmers adopted improved crop varieties and only 25 % include fertilizers to land, in other words, Mexican farmers are still driving low-input technology systems, which favors low production. They should implement agro-ecological methods in vulnerable agricultural sectors, which have achieved favorable results even in adverse situations. This potential includes a significant increase in production has 4 times, increased stability by diversifying water and soil improvement in diet and contribution to food security. Finally, note that the problems of sustainability that Latin American countries face are many and complex, so you should seek optimal strategies for effective and fast forward, responding in a decisive manner the increasing demand of the population . It should seek and implement information technology to reach the population concerning the environment and the sustainability of development, since the information found in our countries is degraded, scattered and small, with very little focus on environmental objectives.

 There are five candidates from among the two parties that seem to have a credible chance of winning the presidency at this point (though things are still in flux and no one has actually voted yet). Two of them definitely consider man-made Climate Change to be an issue. However, one of them is a pathological liar and the other has proposals that would ruin the American economy for a generation. Two others have made strong statements against the notion of man-made Climate Change. One is a well-known buffoon and the other is an evangelical. The fifth has also come out on record as being doubtful about man-made Climate Change, though his statements have not been as strong and has made other statements regarding his faith requiring him to be concerned about the environment.

 So, when coming across a potentially misleading article in a high-profile online media outlet, it's often a good idea to check this relatively new website called Climate Feedback. Scientists evaluate media reports about climate change, give them an overall credibility rating, and add comments and explanations to specific and highlighted passages. It's a collaborative and almost real time effort and once complete will show up on their list of feedbacks:
 
 http://climatefeedback.org/feedbacks/
 
 They make use of ""Hypothesis"" a neat online commenting tool for which you can download and install a ""bookmarklet"" in your browser:
 
 https://hypothes.is/
 
 Once you have that installed, you can check any article if public comments have already been added by (climate) scientists.
 
 It's really neat and you'll notice that they also evaluate articles from folks like [Chris Mooney][2] and [Justin Gillis][3] who have been writing high quality articles about climate change for years. After reading some of the reviews and comparing high with low or even very low ([James Taylor, Forbes][4]) scientific credibility, you'll get better with ""eye-balling"" a writer's credibility on your own.

The carbon dioxide (CO2) reacts with water (H2O) in the atmosphere and results in acidic rains.
 
 CO2 + H2O gives H2CO3 which is strong acid for corrosion.
 
 Then, the iron (Fe) as one of the components of the iron sheets reacts with the resulted carbonic acid to give the iron carbonate in a reaction which releases the hydrogen into the atmosphere.
 
 Fe + H2CO3 gives Fe2CO3 and H2 which is released into the atmosphere.

However there are very many scientific journals and many require subscriptions to gain access to the full papers. Their websites will give the title, authors, affiliations and the Abstract - the 1-2 paragraph summary of the paper. 
 
 If you want to read the full paper you then may need a subscription which most of us don't have. 
 
 Google offers a useful tool for finding scientific papers, and possibly finding a non pay-walled copy. Google Scholar, a dedicated search tool for scholarly publications.
 
 [https://scholar.google.com.au/][1]
 
 Type the name of the paper or possibly leas author, year etc and there is a good chance of finding the paper you are looking for. This will link to things like the journal where the paper was published. 
 
 If that journal pay-walls the full text, all is not lost. Sometimes (and increasingly) the authors of papers host a copy on the blog, University webpage etc. And Google Scholar often provides a link to those other copies as well.
 
 For example, [this paper][2] is quite an interesting study from the early history of satellite observations of the Greenhouse Effect. 
 
 If you go to Google Scholar and search for just the lead authors name and the year it was published - Conrath 1970 - Scholar finds it. And on the right will be a link to any other source that might have it.
 
 You can search for the title, author, year. Also add keywords to narrow the search. And many papers are referenced by their DOI number, Scholar can find that too.

 Yes, sea level rise is the result of warming oceans. It melts the large ice masses (like Greenland) and adds volumes of water to the oceans causing them to rise.posted a day ago by theseehawks.

 TL;DR? There was virtually no oxygen in the atmosphere until 2.33 billion years ago. That's the time that the ""Great Oxygenation Event"" occurred -- fueled by cyanobacteria. In just 10 million years there was enough O2 that it affected mineral weathering. Though we didn't reach the current ~21% for some time.

 Bold Carbon-free New Age project
 
 There is no drama intended as I report today of the commissioning a $200 million carbon-free greenhouse project near remote Port Augusta, South Australia. No - greenhouse does not mean it is powered by greenhouse gas! 
 
 Owner Sundrop Farms will produce under a ten year contract 15,000 tons of truss tomatoes each year for the Australian supermarket operator Coles.
 
 Yesterday I reported the very recent closure of a substantial coal-fired power station and coal-mine near Port Augusta and consequent loss of jobs. A steel mill also closed there recently. New jobs will be welcomed.
 
 This is a classic example of communities transitioning to the new age.
 Sundrop Farms operations will be primarily powered by a new concentrated solar thermal power plant with a generating capacity of 1.5 Megawatts. Seawater will be withdrawn from Spencer Gulf and desalinated to feed produce. 
 
 RCP3PD requires a limitation on future cumulative emissions of 560 GtonC - our notional bank to keep below a global 2 degC temperature rise. As farm emissions are very significant this project is an example to farm and horticulture industries in shrinking emissions and keeping pressure off our warming world.

Climate Change is increasingly topical in Australia where I live - it is to a significant degree also controversial. Some people say ""god is the cause"", some say ""CO2 is the food of plants; that's good"", some say ""a warmer climate is good for us"". As a result we have political parties with conflicting policies on climate change. The fact is civilised societies have evolved ""scientific method"" - the intellectual process of observation, measurement, hypothesis and testing and adjustment. Over a century ago science explained ""the greenhouse-effect"" in which a trace amount of CO2 enabled earth's temperature to stay within a range which supported the evolution of humans. The IPCC shows us with virtually certainty that human activity is now very rapidly elevating CO2 levels and global temperature to levels unprecedented in the last 800,000 years. There is a need for cogent policy on climate. The community looks to science to provide reliable pictures/policies of a myriad of future situations usually supported by models.

How do you define ""top of the atmosphere"". Is it the top of the Exosphere, which I understand to be the highest atmospheric layer? Or is it the top of the Thermosphere? The Mesopause was defined as the edge of space around 60 years ago by Theodore von Kármán. If the Mesopause is the top of the atmosphere the profs temperature estimate is off by a long shot because the temperature there is around 173°K, not the 255°K given as an answer. The mesopause happens to be the coldest point in the atmosphere. So which is it that she is referring to? I ask that because specifics are important since these layers have vastly different heights and conditions but also because the NASA graph below also contradicts the temperature estimates she gave as the answer. Climate science discussions require accuracy and precision especially when defining terms like the top of the atmosphere, otherwise climate change deniers will be all over you for sloppy inaccurate statements.![Atmospheric Layers and Temperature produced by NASA][1]

 I went back over some energy flows in Module 2.2 and felt something was not gelling with me:-
 
 Slide showing two incoming flows, solar + greenhouse for a combined flux of 500 W/m2.
 Does this purport to be an example from the real world? Could we see the derivation of this figure?
 
 However going ahead I had a go at estimating the temperature on this square meter and came-up with 33.44 degC (using Stephan-Boltzmann from course notes.) 
 
 So after setting up the formula in the spreadsheet I had a list suggesting each increment of one W/m2 increased temperature by 0.15 degC.
 
  Adding 4 W/m2 increased T by 0.61 degC.
 
 I am aware in my reading that sensitivity is defined by a doubling of CO2 concentrations (which seems very arbitrary). 
 
 Could you provide guidance on the statement in course notes “DOUBLE atmospheric CO2, ADDS about 4 W/m2. INCREASES Earth’s temperature by about 3 degC.”",t

colinmahony,TA,UBCx/Climate1x/2T2016,570e7eba6fcfa505480003f1,initial_post,Tips & Tricks for edX Discussions,0,"Here are some tips to help you navigate the edX Discussion forums for Climate1x.
 
 **Navigating the forums**
 
 Accessing the forums works best via the corresponding menu item:
 
 ![][1]
 
 Check out the three drop-down menus:
 
  - (1) Use the list to pick a specific view or sub-forum to access - “All Discussions” is the default and “Posts I’m Following” comes in handy to keep track of posts you want to keep an eye on (if you read an interesting discussion, click on the “star” in the first comment to start following it - you’ll have to do this manually even for posts you replied to) 
 
 ![enter image description here][2]
 
  - (2) If you want to read-up on forum content since you last visited, select “Unread” from this drop-down to narrow down the posts displayed:
 
 ![enter image description here][3]
 
 > Note: if you want to refresh the list of displayed posts, toggle
 > between “Show all” and “Unread” in the drop-down - do not refresh the
 > page via your browser as this will reset the main selection to “All
 > Discussions” and you’ll need to switch this back manually to the view
 > you were in.
 
  - (3) The third drop-down can be used to determine the sort-order with “recent activity” most likely being the most helpful one. Posts created or replied to recently will show up at the top of the list then:
 
 ![enter image description here][4]
 
 **How to know what might have changed**
 
 If the number is white on blue, it means that the post was created new since you last visited:
 
 ![enter image description here][5]
 
 If the number is black on white, a response or comment was added to a post (or some other update happened, like editing a comment)
 
 ![enter image description here][6]
 
 If the number is black on grey, then your response or comment was the last one added or there was no new activity at all.
 
 ![enter image description here][7]
 
 **Check out pinned forum posts**
 
 Some forum posts - usually created by Community TAs or Staff - have been pinned to the top in order to make them “stand out” and be easily accessible. Make sure to check them out as they contain important information!
 
 ![enter image description here][8]
 
 **Finding new content in long threads**
 
 In some posts with many responses and comments it can be difficult to locate new content via scrolling through it. What you can then do is to use your browser’s search function by hitting CTRL+F. In Firefox a search box will be displayed e.g. at the bottom of the window: 
 
 ![enter image description here][9]
 
 Depending on how long ago you last checked a post, you can now search for “hour”, “minute” or “day” to find recent updates.
 
 ![enter image description here][10]
 
 **Looking for posts with specific content**
 
 You can use the search box to see if others have already posted about something you’d like to discuss:
 
 ![enter image description here][11]
 
 You can also look for posts by one of your coursemates by entering her/his username:
 
 ![enter image description here][12]
 
 If you click on the highlighted bar, you’ll end up at the overview page listing all posts and comments by the student.
 
 **Follow links from posts with the CTRL-key clicked**
 If you just click on a link within a forum-post, the page will be opened in the same tab. If you then use the back-function to go back to the forum-post, the edX platform always does a page refresh which loses any restrictions you may have had set previously via the drop-downs and revert back to “All discussions” and “Show All”.
 
 **Creating a new post (edX-lingo for thread)**
 
 ![enter image description here][13]
 
  - (1) Click on the “New Post” button from any forum page; 
  - (2) decide if it’s going to be a question or discussion; 
  - (3) select the relevant sub-forum via the “TOPIC AREA” list; 
  - (4) give your post a meaningful title; 
  - (5) as you add your post, remember that you can add text formatting, pictures, links, quoteboxes, etc. to enrich your content; and 
  - (6) finish by clicking “add post”.
 
 **Options available for a post**
 
 The options available depend on whether it’s your own or a coursemate’s post, but you have up to three options available:
 
 ![enter image description here][14]
 
 You can upvote a post or response a coursemate posted by clicking on “+”. You can decide to follow a post by clicking on “*”. What you see for the more-menu “...” depends on whether it’s your own post or not.
 
 ![enter image description here][15]
 
 If you discover typos or similar issues with your own post, response or comment, you can correct it by selecting “Edit” from the more-menue.
 If the post doesn’t follow the forum guidelines you can report it. Unfortunately, this sets a flag but doesn’t tell us why it was reported as the edX-forums don’t yet have a means via which you can add a comment only visible to staff explaining why you flagged something.
 
 Hope this helps!

Astrosharp,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/2T2016,5749e613f012b7055c000418,initial_post,Very Simple Climate Model in a Spreadsheet,1,"Hi all,
 
 I was interested in the 'Very, Very Simple Climate Model' that we looked at in Module 5. I had a look around the UCAR website that the Flash model is on and I found a page that described the equations that are behind the model, and I thought I might have a go at implementing my own version of the model in an Excel spreadsheet.
 
 The details of the equations (there are quite simple) are here: http://eo.ucar.edu/staff/rrussell/climate/modeling/co2_climate_model_activity.html
 
 You can download my version in an Excel spreadsheet from my website here: http://www.astro-sharp.com/temp/ubcx/VerySimpleClimateModel_1.xlsx
 
 There are 2 sheets in the Excel workbook. The main one is called 'Model' and this is where the figures of CO2 level and temperature are calculated according to the equations on the UCAR website and there is also as chart. The secind sheet called 'Parameters' has the various input values that the model needs. You can change these and see the effect on the figures in the model.
 
 It looks like the proper version on the UCAR website has got some more refined factors in the model because the CO2 levels go down over the years if you set the CO2 emissions parameter to zero, whereas in my simple version they just level off.
 
 I found it interesting that the equations are not fundamental physics like the Stefan-Boltzmann law for example but rather there are empirical equations based on observations and measurements.
 
 It took about an hour to do this - feel free to add more sophistication into it. I'd like to add the function so that the model represents the absorption of CO2 by the oceans for example.

 I found the exercise near the end of Module 2 to be very interesting. I live in the central part of the south coast of England and I found it easy to find monthly average temperature data for this part of England because the UK Met Office seems to keep good records and publishes them in an easy-to-find way. I wondered how easy others found it to find the data they needed for this excercise?
 
 Also, my result was that the anomaly for April 2016 was almost zero - i.e.almost exactly the same as the 1980's average, but April has been really cold here in the UK because we have had an unusual Easterly and sometimes Northerly airflow over much of the country. Everyone has been moaning! I tried the same thing for last December and the anomaly came out at +5.1C.

 I am Julián Gallego, I am mechanical engineer and I have decided to take this course because this is a important issue which we must be aware for the next decades.
 
 Talking about the question, the role the science plays in decision-making is vital. I think the science is the meaning of the evolution and our planet is evolving according to our activity or habits. If you consume more food we produce more waste. If you consume more food we produce more wastes. Thus, the agriculture and livestock would increase if we keep consuming more and more food, and we would finally be increasing the greenhouse emissions.
 
 And this is just one subject of this field. There are many others that I believe we will be discussing the next weeks.

 https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/asset-v1:UBCx+Climate1x+2T2016+type@asset+block/M3-2_Q1.jpg
 
 The precision of the figures are vitally important. Error estimates are not provided in the course or in the 2009 paper (that I could find) where the updated numbers originate.
 
 It's important because class questions using this updated chart are used to prove there is an energy imbalance of 0.9W/m-squared due to the greenhouse effect.
  
 If accurate within the error estimates then that's very compelling evidence supporting the theory of human-caused global warming. It's necessary to AGW theory that the imbalance exists.
 
 However, the imbalance is so small that I got the question about the energy balance at the TOA wrong because I used the rounded figures. (I didn't notice the figures out to tenths of a watt at first)
 
 Natural effects, such as solar TSI cyclically varying by about 1W/m-squared, could affect the result, especially given the short time period the data was collected.
 
 Why aren't all the figures in the chart expressed out to tenths? Without that level of accuracy, the TOA imbalance is undetectable. 
 
 I'm puzzled... 
 The chart used in IPCC AR4 showed no imbalance at all. It was based on empirical data collected in the late 1980s when the temperature was rising and therefore there should have been an imbalance.
 
 The updated chart, however, uses empirical data collected in the first few years of the 2000s when there was very little temperature rise and, thus, should have shown less of an imbalance.
 
 How is that explained?",t

 In my expertise, there is a small part of the society fighting against climate change. One part of it, doesn't know, ***unlike us***, what is happening with global temperature and what components within the atmosphere causes it, and the another part, is trying to counteract it, fighting against *political powers*. Obviously, political powers know what is affecting the global temperature but they always blame CO2. Why? Because the society doesn't read or doesn't care about, at least. Why I've said this? Because my country is facing *the peace process*, and one part of the society has never read about it, and what restrictions or key points have been taken. The remaining part wants to reach the end of the armed conflict. More of 50 years of conflict. I want it.
 
 On the other hand, there is no relationship between ozone depletion and global warning. Why? It is clear that water vapour is the main actor here. The ozone layer has been decreasing because my field used substances such as CFC (Chlorofluorocarbon), HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) and other substances like Asahiflon, Daiflon, Eskimo, FCC, etc[1]. When these substances are released within the atmosphere, reacts with the ozone and causes its destruction. Therefore, these substances had to be replaced.
 
 I am now working on how to counteract the climate change and what kind of components we can use to manage the ozone. This course have been very, very interesting for me and everything I have could learn. 
 
 Thank you to the members who wants to discuss in this forum.

Feedback loops have to “feed back”.

 If CO2 is the main driver of climate change, as stated by the IPCC, then why are the two graphs so different?
 
 Starting in the late 1940s the temperature profile shows a slight decline until the late 1970s and it levels off after 2000. The CO2 curve does not show any such behavior.

KimHackett,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/2T2016,573738e542c3ca053f0000ce,initial_post,Amplifying and Stabilizing feedbacks outside of climate,0,"Amplifying real world feedback examples that have nothing to do with climate are present in the world around us all the time. The most common and often seen (whether we notice or not) is the drive between supply and demand. The more that items are supplied to people around the world the more used they are to having such items, the more the demand to maintain flow of said items. Because I am certain I wont be the only person to use that example let me present one more. The biological amplifying feedback present in the drive to feed a new born child. The birth itself creates and increase in hormones that allow for the production of breast milk. The birth of the child and its subsequent hunger increases hormone production increasing the stock of milk in the body. 
 An example of stabilizing feedback I am most familiar with is the predator/prey relationships present in the Lotka-Volterra Model. i.e the relationship between wolves and moose. Moose births increase leading to more food for the wolves, as a response the wolf population increases. There are now too many wolves for the prey population to handle so prey dramatically drops. Once this happens the predators follow closely the curve of their preferred prey. (Of course there are many details left out here, this biological system isn't closed and influx and out of individuals may alter the results a bit) but essentially they stabilize each others population at a basic ""tolerable level"" maintaining a semblance of order and establishing the carrying capacity of each species in a particular area.",t

Citrus909,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/2T2016,576362767e622b053c0008d4,initial_post,AFTER GLOBAL WARMING,0,"Two scenarios are developed:- 
 Moderate Scenario - Cumulative human carbon emissions end up about 1000 Gton C 
 Extreme Scenario - Cumulative human carbon emissions end up about 5000 Gton C.
 
 COMPARING ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS
 
 Moderate Scenario - the current level is just less than 400 ppm steeply rising to 550 - 600 ppm by around 2200 AD before a sharp decline which flattens out into a long even decline to around 300 ppm by 100,000 years from now.
 
 Extreme Scenario – air-borne CO2 concentrations reach 1900 – 2000 ppm by 2300 AD, then fall relatively steeply for several thousand years but do not return to today’s levels for at least 400,000 years from now.
 
 COMPARING TEMPERATURES
 
 Moderate Scenario - global mean temperatures are likely to climb 2 – 3 degrees higher than today by 2200 – 2300 AD, then enter a cooling recovery phase lasting as much as 100,000 years.
 
 Extreme Scenario - global mean temperature jumps 6 – 9 deg C above today’s average and remains not much lower than peak from 3000 AD to 4000 AD and do not return to today’s levels for at least 400,000 years from now.
 
 COMPARING SEA LEVELS
 
 Moderate Scenario - Much of Greenland’s and Antarctica’s ice sheets will melt into the oceans over millennia, lifting sea levels several meters higher than today before slowly receding.
 
 Extreme Scenario - All land-based ice eventually melts raising sea levels by as much as 70 meters until the world cools enough for large polar ice sheets to form again - roughly half a million years from now.
 
 EXPLAINING FIGURE 2
 
 Figure 2 is a single graph of the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in our atmosphere plotted against time (in thousands of years). The background for this graph is Moderate CO2 Emission – which restricts cumulative emissions since 1750 to 1000 GTONS and which keeps a rise in earth’s temperature below 2 degC. Implicit in this is declining rates of annual net CO2 emission.
 Notable points on the graph are the current concentrations of CO2, just below 400 ppm, the abrupt turning-down point around 550 ppm and an end point around below 300 ppm.
 
 The notes on the graph are salient processes causing change in our climate and planet e.g. “Ocean Uptake” broadly explains why CO2 concentration stops rising: – in gaseous form it dissolves in sea water to produce a weak acid, “Carbonate Weathering” indicates the conversion of carbonate rocks and shells/skeletons of sea creatures including corals by carbonic acid to other solid forms. Tacitly included in this is CO2 dissolved in rain delivered to the ocean via river flows and ground water. “Silicate Weathering” - there are limits to carbonate weathering before dissolved CO2 is expunged – from which point it slowly reacts with silicate rocks over a long time and reaches low concentrations.
  
 EXPLAINING FIGURE 3
 
 Figure 3 is a collection of graphs of key variables in our climate system. The background for this graph is Extreme CO2 Emission – which restricts cumulative emissions since 1750 to 5000 GTONS and which keeps a peak rise in earth’s temperature in the range 5 - 9 degC. It assumes we burn through all remaining coal reserves before switching to renewable resources. 
 Annual Emissions appear to rise and peak around 2100 AD and then decline sharply to zero - no doubt associated with rising costs of carbon based fuels and/or a movement to renewable energies.
 
 A striking aspect of the graphs is this rise, peak and fall in annual emissions precedes all three other peaks shown – CO2 concentration, Thermal and Sea Level. There is a long lingering impact on climate left by this massive carbon perturbation.
 
 The peak CO2 concentration occurs later around 2300 AD at 2000 ppm followed by a long period of relatively high CO2 concentration. 
 The thermal peak (5 – 9 degC) occurs later again probably around 3600 AD 
 Sea level rise (70 meters or more) continues to rise slightly to the year 4000 AD where the graph ends.
 We can surmise all land-based ice eventually melts raising sea levels by as much as 70 meters until the world cools enough for large polar ice sheets to form again - roughly half a million years from now.
 
 LONG-TERM TRADE-OFFS, ETHICS
 
 It is acknowledged that such science based projections undoubtedly with a high level of uncertainty do provoke thought for humans to consider weighing the needs of some generations against those of others. It is the age of humans. We can and do influence climate.
 That a future population may find itself facing adaptation to and mitigation of a deepening new ice age and not have the option of going to hydro-carbons because previous generations have exhausted them, deserves consideration. 
 The earth in effect has been a re-chargeable battery since the evolution of life – powered by the sun. The evolution of green plants on sea and land and photosynthesis have ensured the battery has plenty of charge by way of hydro-carbons – it took eons to do it but we have substantially drawn on the battery over some 270 years. 
 Is it improper drain the battery because we may neglect long-term future generations? No – because humans will always have the sun and their enduring intellect and hopefully surviving ethics and respect for others. Which means when the hydro-carbon battery is dry humans will be tapping the earth’s inner heat, energy from waves, wind and direct solar technologies. They will be using lithium-ion and other materials for energy storage and sharing.
 
 I don’t think our generation will leave the long-term future in the lurch.
 
 I consider a higher question is: do we drain the battery in the short-term – no, because of the massive risk to the climate in the shorter term. See “Explaining Figure 3” above.
 I consider ethics demand great effort in the peaceful reigning-in of carbon emissions over the short-term. RCP3PD should be the Holy Grail.",t
kwight,Student,UBCx/Climate1x/2T2016,57533c12e13629051700085f,initial_post,Is this Government of BC logging spin?,2,"I've been looking into the effects of forests with respect to the carbon cycle for assignment 2. I came across [this Government of BC document][1], ""Climate mitigation potential of British Columbian forests: Growing carbon sinks"", and read the following in the executive summary (emphasis mine):
 
 > The carbon cycle in forests is characterized by long periods of slow
 > carbon uptake during growth accompanied by relatively short periods of

 Is the government suggesting that we're better off cutting down trees to create ""carbon stores"", than just leaving them there to absorb carbon while growing over time? Or am I missing something?..

Due to the human activities different gases like chlorofluorocarbons, methane and carbon dioxide these are the gases which deplete the ozone layer. Ozone is also a gas which protect the earth from the ultraviolet rays from the sun. if the ozone will more deplete then the ultraviolet rays from sun directly reach the earth and will defiantly effect the earth. Human beings are the main actors who are depleting the ozone layer. Haman beings are degrading the environment. Science is progressing day by day and new discoveries are happened. A lot of heavy rocket launchers are damaging the ozone layer. As we are seeing that how much vehicles are manufacturing in the world and most of the world population is using high class vehicles as my point of view is that we have to use alternate options to control over this issue. Usage of Eco-friendly and natural cleaning products for household chores is a great way to prevent ozone depletion. We should use renewable resources for a sustainable development.",t

 The chart is referenced in several places throughout the course.
 
 A crucial piece of information is never mentioned about that chart. The temperature changes happen FIRST. The CO2 changes follow. The National Academy of Sciences points that out:
 [NAS - CO2 changes lag behind temperature changes][2]
 
 Even the most casual non-scientist knows that if CO2 changes lag behind temperature changes then that means temperature changes are driving the observed CO2 changes. Temperature change is the cause. CO2 change is the effect.
 
 Why is that highly significant fact never mentioned in Modules 1 or 2?

colinmahony,TA,UBCx/Climate1x/2T2016,570e80ae6fcfa505450003f7,initial_post,Welcome to the Troubleshooting Forum,20,"Welcome, everyone!
 
 This is your Troubleshooting discussion forum where you can get in touch with staff and other participants about any specific issues, especially technical problems, that you might be encountering with course material. If you're wanting to ask about general topics related to climate science or chat about concepts with fellow participants, it would be better to use other discussion threads.
 
 Before you post a question here, you should try a couple of things first:
 
  - For technical issues, first check your computer to make sure it isn't a problem with your computer or internet,
  - Then check the edX help button located on the left of your screen to see if their information can help you or post your problem with the platform to them directly,
  - Finally, post here with precise and detailed queries so that we can best help you;
 
 For course-related questions, be sure to check the information in ""[About Climate Change: The Science][1]"" in the ""Course"" tab carefully.
 
 Staff will be checking this discussion forum regularly, but please be patient! We can't always reply immediately, especially given the different time zones.
 
 In the meantime, you might well find that a fellow participant can provide you with an answer, and we encourage you all to read others' posts to help out where you can. You might be surprised how much you can learn from one another!
 
 Other tips: 
 
  - Search the forum to check if a fellow participant has encountered and
  mentioned the same issue already. If you are lucky, then a solution
  has already been posted in the forum and there's no need to create
  another thread about it.
  - If there is a related thread but no solution yet, feel free to add
  more information to it. For tracking down technical issues, there's
  no such thing as too much information!
  - If you don't find anything relevant yet, start a new thread (or post) here in the Troubleshooting forum with these three steps:
  - (1) Click on ""New Post"" near the top of the forum page
  - (2) Select the ""Troubleshooting"" forum from the TOPIC AREA drop-down
  - (3) Add a meaningful title to reflect the issue you encountered
 
 ![enter image description here][2]
 
 Then, describe the issue in as much detail as possible so that it can be reproduced by course staff.

Please see Table 3 in his book,also pages 167-168 in his book "" Cool it: the skeptical environmentalist 's guide to global warming, Marshall Cavendish Publishers ,2010.
 Since he appears to support a small Carbon Tax of Us$2/ton of Carbon, I presume he considers it like a third party insurance for a car to extend his car example and restricting the speed limit to 5kph. In his view the society accepts a small Carbon Tax as a car third party insurance but not 5 kph ,as a choice to prevent road deaths.

I heard that thin clouds are white because they scatter all frequencies of light equally well. But as the clouds get thicker, more and more lights get absorbed by the water droplets and ice crystals. That's why thick clouds are dark. This makes sense to me but it contradicts Dr. Harris' statement of thick clouds are more reflective than thin ones. In the last video of ""Reflection of incoming solar radiation,"" Dr. Harris advanced an intriguing hypothesis of increasing Earth's surface temp keeping the evaporated water in vapor form. The greenhouse effect plus the decreased reflectivity from less cloud formation will further increase Earth's temp. But as water vapor ascends, it will expand due to decreased surrounding atmospheric pressure. The expanding vapor is performing positive work and it will decrease its internal energy thus its temp will drop. Sometimes the drop in temp is so fast that the water vapor is turned into ice with sufficient mass such that even the upsurging warm air can not hold it up and we have hailstorms. What went wrong with my thinking here?",t

There is a TV Show on Discovery Channel called Racing Extinction which premiered yesterday. And it is a 2015 production. The first half hour of it does talk about animal extinction. But in the second half hour they are talking about the effects of climate change. How the oceans are absorbing carbon and how it's turning them more acidic which then jeopardizes shell based marine life. They also discuss methane from cattle and permafrost melt. They lit methane into a flame on top of water to prove it was there.
 
 They just did a part where they used special filters on cameras which made carbon emissions visible. They drove around and you could see the carbon pouring from cars and buildings and even people's breath.
 
 Another part showed that plankton generates oxygen. But plankton are vulnerable to the changes in the ocean from climate change. If we lose that source of oxygen it could have serious impacts.

 These are mainly questions for the staff.
 
 1- How long will we still have access to this course which is now completing? (I'd like to review it and relearn sections so they really sink in.)
 
 2- Is it too late to get a certificate? I did a lot better than I expected. If I recall the cut off date to get that certificate was early on, but I wanted to see how I did. This was my first ever online course.
 If you offer the course in January, will it be similar? I am thinking if it's too late this time, I could get a certificate then.
 
 Also.... Where did the map go? I was having trouble loaded my second assignment to the map. I kept getting an error message. (Can't find the thread it was on here either). Then a family situation arose and I'm just getting back to completing everything this week. The last thing left is getting that assignment up but now the map won't even load.
 
 Any help on getting it posted?
 
 Last but not least THANK YOU! I just did the final exam, during which it occurred to me how much better I understand the climate system and the impact carbon is having. The whole course has been so eye opening especially how everything is so interrelated and interconnected. It's really been a great experience to gain this knowledge. I think it puts us all in a better place on how we can get involved. Dr. Sara Harris was great in the videos. How you taught helped take complex parts and made them understandable, which is not always an easy thing to do. And the staff has always responded on forums in a helpful way. 
 
 So thank you to the entire staff of this course!

 This post is for anyone who wants to let the staff know what they thought of the Essay Assignment 1. Not the technical difficulties part, but what did you think about it in general?
 
 I must say when I joined the class and saw an essay with peer reviews, I was hesitant. I'm a concerned citizen who wants to learn more. I have no previous training. Will my peers be scientists and experts? I also haven't written a graded essay in awhile.
 
 The rubicon was very helpful. It clearly stated what to include and what to look for when reviewing peers. Thank you for adding that in! It gave me the direction I needed and more.
 
 The idea of adding our essays to the map so we can go see what's happening all over the world is wonderful! I am learning so much from this, because it helps me to ""see"" what areas are having what issues, which gives me a better worldwide concept.
 
 The peer comments were helpful. The critiquing was constructive. And Peer 2's final comments made my day! Thank you whoever you are!
 
 So I went from being hesitant about this assignment to thoroughly enjoying it. I've learned so much from reading my peer's work. This was a very well thought assignment. It took this course to a more deeper and richer level of learning for me by having participated in this interaction. Thank you for it!",a

Greenhouse gases that human activity produce affect the entire planet as a system. With our activity we release gases and that gases affect regions a ecosystems that in turn release more greenhouse gases but, what should we do? I believe that the solution can not be in reduce some of the emissions; that only slows the problem. We can not pretend, I would like much this utopian idea, that humans stop trying to get more resources and production for not other reason that competition or money. I believe that the solution have to be in a way that everyone can do it and that not required to teach behavior to the society. If we deposit our expectations in a moderating human behavior, this problem its going to be out the control in a few years. 
 But what possibilities leaves us? I do not know, maybe we can paint everything white o put mirrors in the ceilings while we found a way to break a CO2 molecule and use the carbon without releasing it to the atmosphere and leave O2 free in the air. Maybe we can find out other energy sources; maybe all countries should start thinking in a efficient way to generated electricity as nuclear plants, without fire atomic bombs to each other; we maybe should star using just public transportation and that should be running with electricity.

 My answer was yes. If regional annual average climate just is an average across the input of ongoing weather, then doesn't virtually any new input produce a change in it? While it is a minuscule change and it might not have an effect on how we describe a region's climate generally, the numerical value would be different. Isn't that right? If not, why not?
 
 Am I misunderstanding how you input new data into the average? I'm assuming it's rolling, whereas you might introduce a set of data points all at one time. Then you *could* have had the lowest temperature recorded during the same period, and it might have worked out that those two data points cancel each other out in such a way that the average didn't change.

colinmahony,TA,UBCx/Climate101x/3T2015,561fee38d2aca5b29c0007ac,initial_post,Tips & tricks for edX discussions,0,"Here are some tips to help you navigate the edX Discussion forums for Climate1x.
 
 **Navigating the forums**
 
 Accessing the forums works best via the corresponding menu item:
 
 ![][1]
 
 Check out the three drop-down menus:
 
  - (1) Use the list to pick a specific view or sub-forum to access - “All Discussions” is the default and “Posts I’m Following” comes in handy to keep track of posts you want to keep an eye on (if you read an interesting discussion, click on the “star” in the first comment to start following it - you’ll have to do this manually even for posts you replied to) 
 
 ![enter image description here][2]
 
  - (2) If you want to read-up on forum content since you last visited, select “Unread” from this drop-down to narrow down the posts displayed:
 
 ![enter image description here][3]
 
 > Note: if you want to refresh the list of displayed posts, toggle
 > between “Show all” and “Unread” in the drop-down - do not refresh the
 > page via your browser as this will reset the main selection to “All
 > Discussions” and you’ll need to switch this back manually to the view
 > you were in.
 
  - (3) The third drop-down can be used to determine the sort-order with “recent activity” most likely being the most helpful one. Posts created or replied to recently will show up at the top of the list then:
 
 ![enter image description here][4]
 
 **How to know what might have changed**
 
 If the number is white on blue, it means that the post was created new since you last visited:
 
 ![enter image description here][5]
 
 If the number is black on white, a response or comment was added to a post (or some other update happened, like editing a comment)
 
 ![enter image description here][6]
 
 If the number is black on grey, then your response or comment was the last one added or there was no new activity at all.
 
 ![enter image description here][7]
 
 **Check out pinned forum posts**
 
 Some forum posts - usually created by Community TAs or Staff - have been pinned to the top in order to make them “stand out” and be easily accessible. Make sure to check them out as they contain important information!
 
 ![enter image description here][8]
 
 **Finding new content in long threads**
 
 In some posts with many responses and comments it can be difficult to locate new content via scrolling through it. What you can then do is to use your browser’s search function by hitting CTRL+F. In Firefox a search box will be displayed e.g. at the bottom of the window: 
 
 ![enter image description here][9]
 
 Depending on how long ago you last checked a post, you can now search for “hour”, “minute” or “day” to find recent updates.
 
 ![enter image description here][10]
 
 **Looking for posts with specific content**
 
 You can use the search box to see if others have already posted about something you’d like to discuss:
 
 ![enter image description here][11]
 
 You can also look for posts by one of your coursemates by entering her/his username:
 
 ![enter image description here][12]
 
 If you click on the highlighted bar, you’ll end up at the overview page listing all posts and comments by the student.
 
 **Follow links from posts with the CTRL-key clicked**
 If you just click on a link within a forum-post, the page will be opened in the same tab. If you then use the back-function to go back to the forum-post, the edX platform always does a page refresh which loses any restrictions you may have had set previously via the drop-downs and revert back to “All discussions” and “Show All”.
 
 **Creating a new post (edX-lingo for thread)**
 
 ![enter image description here][13]
 
  - (1) Click on the “New Post” button from any forum page; 
  - (2) decide if it’s going to be a question or discussion; 
  - (3) select the relevant sub-forum via the “TOPIC AREA” list; 
  - (4) give your post a meaningful title; 
  - (5) as you add your post, remember that you can add text formatting, pictures, links, quoteboxes, etc. to enrich your content; and 
  - (6) finish by clicking “add post”.
 
 **Options available for a post**
 
 The options available depend on whether it’s your own or a coursemate’s post, but you have up to three options available:
 
 ![enter image description here][14]
 
 You can upvote a post or response a coursemate posted by clicking on “+”. You can decide to follow a post by clicking on “*”. What you see for the more-menu “...” depends on whether it’s your own post or not.
 
 ![enter image description here][15]
 
 If you discover typos or similar issues with your own post, response or comment, you can correct it by selecting “Edit” from the more-menue.
 If the post doesn’t follow the forum guidelines you can report it. Unfortunately, this sets a flag but doesn’t tell us why it was reported as the edX-forums don’t yet have a means via which you can add a comment only visible to staff explaining why you flagged something.
 
 Hope this helps!

 I was a university teacher of ""Environmental Law "" in the Catholic University Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo and in the Lambayeque's University, both of Chiclayo's city, between the year 2011 and 2013. During that time I was the representative of the Catholic University Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo in the Environmental Interuniversity Network MINAM – ANR of the Ministry of Environment - Perú, and the Coordinator of the Juridical Clinic in Environmental Matter of the Law Faculty of that University. 
 Actually I´m a consultant in environmental management of investment projects and a Legal Adviser of the Direction of Environmental Evaluation of Internal Trade of the General Direction of Environmental Matters at the Ministry of the Production of the Republic of Perú, since January, 2014.
 
 I hope that we all could enjoy this course and learn more about the climate change and his different effects in our planet. Also, I expect to be able to know all of you and that we could become good friends.

To put in stock and flow language, the in flow is greater than the out flow and the stock is growing. Surprising to hear this, when all the latest news until now has been that Antarctica is losing ice overall. ICESat-2 is scheduled to launch in 2018 and will get a lot more detailed info about the state of the ice. 
 
 If you are an activist at all, please do whatever you can to help get Rep. Lamar Smith removed from the Science and Technology committee. He heads it up and wants to reduce funding to NASA and NOAA for satellites like ICESat and others because he doesn't think global warming is real, so therefore there's no reason to spend money to send satellites up to study the Earth. I'm lucky; all my representatives are democrats. But if you have republican representatives, it's worth inundating them with emails asking them to keep funding NASA and NOAA to study the Earth.

 My thought is that perhaps after this class is done we can devise some way to contribute to the fight against climate change.

 Any more thoughts on this article on Indonesia? And how adaptability might be the, albeit unfortunate, more realistic option that mitigation at this late date?

 I had discovered the videos of the previous course, Climate literacy, a few months ago, and found them extremely interesting and useful. It launched me onto a path of discovery; It pushed me into updating my maths, physics and chemistry in order to answer those nagging questions: how, why etc. Then I got rather lost in the enormity of the subject.
 
 Suddenly, this course appeared, and it has brought together all the myriad aspects of my learning to date. I still can't decide if I'm more fascinated by paleo-climatology, oceanography, the atmosphere or the cryosphere, but I do know that now I'll continue studying.
 
 I loved the model simulators - even when I'd managed to save the world but knew that in reality it wouldn't happen. The extra readings gave me some great links and were very useful and interesting, particularly the UCL online text book.
 
 Sara Harris is now one of my favourite climate scientists (the other one being Kevin Anderson). So a huge thank you for re-doing this course.

It was extremely interesting in all its parts.
 
 The assignment part was very, very interesting despite the problems (something that I am absolutely sure the staff will find a way to solve). It was also helpful, through the rubric instructions, in improving writing.
 
 The staff responded immediately to every question, doubt, and even complaint although they are part of a university staff (something very demanding both in time and effort). Therefore, congratulation is very little. 
 
 So, I would like to express my gratitude to the staff for this course with the wish that someday they provide another course - a next level of the current (please do notify me in such a case).
 
 I would also like to thank my “co-students” in this course for their interesting posts and their peer reviewing.

JamesWilcox,Student,UBCx/Climate101x/3T2015,561dd052c762770c660005b8,initial_post,"What is ""positive feedback""?",0,"In the “Climate Change Survey,” Q1.1 asks about positive feedback loops. I believe that none of the responses is correct (I can choose a “best” one, but even that one can be argued with).
 
 A positive feedback causes a furtherance—an increase—an amplification—of the initiating perturbation. That feedback could either benefit, slow down, speed up, or harm climate change, depending upon the specific “loop.”
 
 “Positive” does not necessarily mean “benefits climate change,” “slows down climate change,” speeds up climate change,” nor “harms climate change.”
 
 “Positive” means that if a change is made to a system, the system is changed even more than the initial change. “Negative” means that if a change is made to a system, the system tends to “self correct” and not change as much as the initial change—the end effect is that the initial change is diminished within the system.
 
 I think an important thing to be realized here about feedback loops is that “positive” does not necessarily mean “good,” nor does “negative” mean “bad.”",t

 This is your Troubleshooting discussion forum where you can get in touch with staff and other students about any specific issues, especially technical problems, that you might be encountering with course material. If you're wanting to ask about general topics related to climate science or chat about concepts with fellow students, it would be better to use the General Discussion board, which has been set up as just such a space.
 
 Before you post a question here, you should try a couple of things first:
 
  - For technical issues, first check your computer to make sure it isn't a problem with your computer or internet,
  - Then check the edX help button located on the left of your screen to see if their information can help you or post your problem with the platform to them directly,
  - Finally, post here with precise and detailed queries so that we can best help you;
 
 For course related questions, be sure to check the course syllabus carefully.
 
 Staff will be checking this discussion forum regularly, but please be patient! We can't always reply immediately, especially given the different time zones.
 
 In the meantime, you might well find that a fellow student can provide you with an answer, and we encourage you all to read others' posts to help out where you can. You might be surprised how much you can learn from one another!
 
 This thread is closed to avoid different issues getting reported as responses. To make us aware of technical issues, please do the following:
 
  - Search the forum to check if a fellow student has encountered and mentioned the same issue already. If you are lucky, then a solution has already been posted in the forum and there's no need to create another thread about it. If there is a related thread but no solution yet, feel free to add more information to it. For tracking down technical issues, there's no such thing as too much information!
  - If you don't find anything relevant yet, start a new thread (or post) in the Troubleshooting forum with these three steps:
  - (1) Click on ""New Post"" near the top of the forum page
  - (2) Select the ""Troubleshooting"" forum from the TOPIC AREA drop-down
  - (3) Add a meaningful title to reflect the issue you encountered
 
 ![enter image description here][1]
 
 Then, describe the issue in as much detail as possible so that it can be reproduced by course staff.

If you do that -- and learn just a little more about the hazards of petrochemical refineries in our atmosphere -- and discover how the ecosystems of barrier islands and off-shore undersea forests of seagrass can help restore a devastating amount of toxic pollution that these refineries are pouring into our atmosphere. Then I think the deduction of a few points on this survey well deserves the deduction. I'll give up 10 or 12 points if my essay can help educate others. I'm doing this to better educate myself on climate change, and how climate change is affecting our island and how climate change will affect out island in the future as our two girls (age 4 and 5) will grow up here, and will hopefully share my concerns for the planet and our local ecosystems in particular.
 
 So, with that in mind, if I lose points, or fail the course, it doesn't matter to me I've discovered a wealth of information about my island and I got the opportunity to share that with others interested in the effects of climate change on our planet. And now I know different non-profit organizations I can work with, or volunteer for to help maintain our local ecosystem and do the very best to be stewards of our land and the ecosystems that it supports.",t

The island is situated between latitudes circle 34 and 36 N and meridians 32 and 35 E. Cyprus has a typical eastern Mediterranean climate: the combined temperature-rainfall regime is characterized by cool-to-mild wet winters and warm-to-hot- dry summers. The climatological annual precipitation of Cyprus is around 500mm. The highest precipitation is recorded in the mountainous areas with 1100mm, while in the coastal areas precipitation is limited to 300-500mm.
 
 From a morphological point of view, the island can be divided into five morphological regions: (a) the mountainous complex of Troodos located at the centre of Cyprus; (b) the mountain range of the Pentadaktylos at the northern part; (c) the central plain of Messaoria located between these two mountain ranges; (d) the hilly areas around the Troodos mountains and the coastal plains. At the southeast of the island there are two salt lakes.
 
 The Troodos mountains with a peak of 1951 m is mostly covered by forests mainly pine, cypress, oaks and cedars. It is estimated that forests cover about 10% of the total area of Cyprus.",t

Now I admit Dr. Harris said nothing untrue. And this piece of data does show an interesting obvious strong temporal correlation between T and [CO2]. The unanswered (so far) question is -- why? 
 
 The answer is known. Temperature drives [CO2], that is the T rises first and this causes an increase in CO2, but the time scale involved is about a 1000 years. This correlation is irrelevant as to whether the modern T increase is due in whole or in part to the modern [CO2] increase.

 I consider myself a skeptic on climate change issues, but I would agree with both statements. Which really means that they don't say much at all about the current debate.

 **What global warming? Antarctic ice is INCREASING by 135billion tonnes a year, says NASA**
 By JON AUSTIN
 PUBLISHED: 12:59, Mon, Nov 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:10, Mon, Nov 2, 2015
 
 A NEW NASA study of the Antarctic from space has thrown the case for climate change into disarray after finding that more new ice has formed at the Antarctic than has been lost to its thinning glaciers.
 
 The US space agency research claims an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is ""currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from melting glaciers.
 
 Global warming theories have been thrown into doubt after NASA also claimed current horror predictions into future sea-level rises may not be as severe.
 
 Major studies previously made the case for global warming being a man-made problem, including the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which said that Antarctica was overall losing land ice.
 
 But a NASA spokesman said: ""According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. 
 
 ""That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008.""

The heating up of the the Caribbean Sea due to global warming has been responsible for many natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and storms. For example in 2014, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and Dominica were affected by hurricanes which resulted in the deaths of many Caribbean Nationals. In 2015 Dominica was again devastated by a flood which was due to the impact of climate change on the environment. Most of the Caribbean countries including Trinidad and Tobago are heavily reliant on tourism, agriculture and fishing to generate their economies and as such the impact of natural disasters due to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer have significant consequences for many of these small island developing countries. (IDB 2013)
 
 The government of Trinidad and Tobago in particular became signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention on Climate Change and has undertaken obligations to reduce the levels of CFCs in the atmosphere which contribute to the greenhouse gas effect. It has in particular placed a ban on aerosol products containing CFCs in order to reduce the impact of greenhouse gases. However because Trinidad and Tobago is an energy based economy there is a need to reduce the level of toxic emissions released into the atmosphere due to natural gases. It is also a worrying concern that there are too many persons on the roads driving motor vehicles which contribute to the greenhouse gas effect as there are several households in Trinidad and Tobago that have more than two motor vehicles per household due to the used car industry. This factor has not only contributed to congestion on the roads but has resulted in the increase in toxic emissions into the atomosphere.
 
 The government of Trinidad and Tobago and the developing countries of the Caribbean region may need to create a policy like Canada and the Netherlands to encourage persons to use bicycles as an alternative mode of transport as this may be a viable means of reducing the level of CFCs into the atmosphere.

 **Sea level change disproportionately affects the global south**
 
 Sea level change is one of the most direct secondary impacts of global climate change, and one that is often ignored by the mainstream discourse. Sea level change is caused in great part due to the melting of specific ice sheets which have trapped water (and carbon) for millennia – especially those in Antarctica which hold enough ice, if all melted, to raise sea levels more than 200 feet (Paolo, Fricker and Padman). Given the magnitude of this, though sea level change will have a global impact, it will be disproportionately felt by poorer nations like Bangladesh in the global south that are heavily agrarian and lack proper planning. 
 Poorer nations are often referred to as the “global south”, given many of them are located in the southern hemisphere, though they do not necessarily have to be so. Additionally, they are typified by economies that are based heavily on agriculture and on medium to low human development across factors including infant mortality, healthcare, adequate water and sanitation infrastructure etc. Many of these countries have lower sea-elevation which makes them more likely to experience flooding and land being reclaimed by the sea due to sea level change. 
 One of the first reasons that poorer nations like Bangladesh will be hit harder by sea level change is due to their economy type. Many of these nations are primarily agrarian, relying directly on agriculture for not only sustenance but also for any secondary income used for other purchases or exchanges in a barter type system. With sea level changes expected to put much fertile land underwater, many of these people will have their livelihoods destroyed and will be forced to move to urban centers with poorer sanitation and living infrastructure. In Bangladesh for instance, 40% of productive land is projected to be lost in the southern region of Bangladesh for a 65cm sea level rise by the 2080s (Bisset). 
 
 Secondly, sea level change is projected to have a disproportionate impact on poorer nations due to improper planning / man-made interventions. Bangladesh experiences flooding and other devastating natural disasters frequently due to its lower than sea level elevation. In part due to this, they have engaged in government and private sector led embankment build projects throughout the coast of the country, especially in areas that are particularly devastated by the flooding, like the island portions of the nation called polders. These man made embankments, unfortunately, have the secondary effect of diverting the natural flow of sediment that up until then were helping increase the elevation of several of the islands (Friedman). Additionally, these embankments are associated with poor drainage and other problems. These manmade contributions to sea level rise should not discount the effect of sea level change that is driven purely by global climate change, but should instead be a reminder that we must be careful and deliberate with our responses to these phenomena. 
 
 Overall, due to a host of factors, including lower elevation, economies that are based heavily on agriculture and, improper manmade interventions poorer nations in the Global South are expected to feel the effects of sea level change in a more pronounced way. Attempting to understand, predict and prepare for sea level change is an unfortunate reality that all nations, not just those in the global south, must prepare for. Many poorer nations, like Bangladesh, are taking a leadership role in this regard, moving the global climate change agenda forward (Bisset). The effect of sea level change, along with the others due to global climate change are those in which we cannot afford to be underprepared.

 In the overview (about the assignment) it says: “Sea level rise due to climate change is projected to cause major impacts in many places around the world. What are those impacts and how do they compare in different places?”
 
 Continuing onto the next page (preparing your assignment), it talks about: “How is sea level rise related to climate change? What scientific evidence can you use to describe or explain the link between climate change and sea level rise impacts?”
 
 Does that mean we have two options?
 
 Either we can talk about the impacts that sea levels will have on specific places (or globally) or we can talk about the link between climate change and sea level rise impacts? 
 
 For example, with the first option, one could look at a region and figure out what would happen if sea levels were to rise in that specific place, like flooding and the consequences of that. 
 
 With the second option, one could talk about (broadly speaking) whether climate change is actually what is causing the sea level rise impacts?

 Thank you in advance!
 The assignment looks like this:
 
 Sea level rise has numerous impacts on the environment, human populations, and bio-diversity. It is caused by warming atmospheric and oceanic temperature causing polar ice sheets melt and thus adding more water in water bodies, which in turn results in submerging of coastal areas, and flooding. However, the impacts of sea-level rise are not homogenously distributed across different places, of the world. In other words, the impact of sea level rise could be seen in such parameters as immediate, long-term, direct, and indirect. For instance, the impacts are, at the immediate-level, felt particularly around coastal places. In some cases, it threatens the very existence of coastal communities and ecosystems. For example, the Bikini Islands (part of Marshall Islands) has been experiencing dramatic sea-level rise that compelled about 1,000 of the Islanders to apply to relocate to the United States in October, 2015. This is due to huge tides and increasing storms (bbc.co.uk). Kiribati has also been buying land from Fiji, due to sea-level rise that threatened its existence. In fact, more than 100 million people live within 1m distance of current sea-level (www.wheelercentre.com/events/new-dystopias-climate-change-fiction). 
 Conversely, in spite of the increasing number of people that live in sea-level risk situations across the world, many regions, example land locked countries are likely to feel the pressure of sea level rise in indirect and long-term fashions. These regions and countries are likely to experience the impact of sea-level rise as part of the changing global atmospheric temperature. For instance, reduction in food production in some areas, attributed to sea-level rise, may have a direct impact on other areas, particularly those that have previously been dependent on the food production of coastal areas (Leggett, 1990). 
 Whatever the case, in the last 150 or so years, sea levels rose by 20cm. By the end of the century, sea-levels are expected to rise 50-100cm above what they were in the 1990s. Unfortunately, sea-levels will continue to change, even we could manage to control climate change for 100s and even 1000s of years. The most vulnerable regions are Southern cost of z Mediterranean, West Coast of Africa, South Asia, Coastal Areas of Southeast Asia, Low-lying coral atolls of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. About 2 billion people live in these regions and 50% of whom earn less than 2 USD or less a day. Additionally, 655 of the world’s “mega cities” are located on low-lying coastal areas, within 10m of sea-levels. “By 2050, 26 major US cities will face an “emerging flooding crisis.” Globally, storm damage could cost cities from Hong Kong to Dhaka to New York trillions annually unless adaptation measures are taken.” Population in these regions is growing rapidly: example, in India (80%) and in Indonesia (60%) will be exposed to sea-level rise over the next century (www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/scientists­predict­huge­sea­level­rise­even­if­we­limit­climate­change 3/3).",t

I realised that we all took very different approaches to the essay. When I looked back at the task directions and rubric, I saw that the instructions were actually kind of vague.
 
 I looked into the specific impacts of sea level rise on different aspects of a specific region and while I did touch on the science and linked sea level rise to global warming briefly, most of my essay was about the impacts {social, political, economic, environmental} of sea level rise. Others took a more science-y route and elaborated greatly on sea level rise and the science behind it, using a case study for a small part of their essay to draw real-life links to evidence.
 
 Whether my approach to the assignment was entirely wrong or not (I hope it wasn't!), I found the variety in responses interesting and I loved reading others' essays. Ah, the internet is wonderful. What a time to be alive!

 you can test it visually by putting some pieces of ice in a glass of water and wait for it to be melted in water.
 you will see no water level change. and it can be physically approved.i mean i can solve it. 
 and why? bcs the amount of water added ( after melting) is exactly the comparable to the amount of current rise in water (caused by pieces of ice) 
 so why do we say ice melting causes sea level rise?
 my answer is that by ices being melted we have more water as liquid (instead of ice) and water volume as liquid is more sensible to temperature change than water as ice
 so if temperature goes up we have a more rise in sea water level. am i right? what do u think?",t

The girl child grows up as an unwanted child and part of the family. She is constantly reminded of how unwanted she is. She grows up hating her life and herself. She is married. Even there is treated simply as a baby producing machine. She would not wish her own life to her worst enemy. A child is conceived. She does not wish a daughter to have the same life as her and hence kills the child as soon as she can determine the sex of the child. Also, she cannot face the insults and beatings she will have once she delivers a girl child. She cannot face it any more and simply wants to survive till her death in peace. Hence, she herself commits self-foeticide if the foetus has female genitalia.
 - This happens with almost all women in the society and the population of females in the society dwindles to low levels till no females are left. This is an example of an **AMPLIFYING FEEDBACK LOOP**.

This has a further stabilizing effect on the popularity of policy makers, causing the voter base stock on which the policy makers count in order to keep their jobs to sharply decrease. In response, the policy makers educate themselves, in order to match the concerns of their voters, and start implementing policies that support sustainable business practices (such as using solar energy, instead of coal, to power businesses).

pbellive,TA,UBCx/Climate101x/3T2015,5636f0f8d2aca52a56001349,initial_post,Comment on feedback loop examples,0,"Hi everyone. It's great to see people engaging with the course material and posting feedback loop examples! Thanks to everyone who's posted! We've seen some great examples. It seems that most people are comfortable with the idea of amplifying feedback but some have a little more trouble with stabilizing feedback. Here are a few general comments based on reading through the examples posted so far:
 
 1) Remember that feedback loops must loop. In an amplifying feedback, a change in a given quantity must lead to a secondary effect that causes a further change of the original quantity in the same direction. Simple cause and effect relationships or examples where multiple causes independently contribute to the same effect are not feedback loops. Consider the following three examples:
 
  a) John eats unhealthy food, which causes him to gain weight.
  b) John eats unhealthy food, which causes him to gain weight. He never exercises because he's too busy, this causes him to gain even more weight.
  c) John eats unhealthy food at the restaurant next door to his home. Eating the unhealthy food causes him to gain weight. The weight gain makes it harder to ride his bicycle to the grocery store to buy healthy food so he eats more unhealthy food and gains more weight.
 
  Scenario c is an example of a feedback loop but a and b are not. Scenario a is a simple cause and effect relationship. In scenario b, poor diet and lack of exercise both contribute to weight gain but they are independent causes. In scenario c the initial weight gain makes it harder for John to find healthy food, which leads to more fast food, which leads to more weight gain, creating a feedback loop.
 
 2) In stabilizing feedbacks, a perturbation of a quantity away from a given value causes an effect that tends to change the quantity back toward its original value. The regulation of the glucose level in the human body is a good example of a stabilizing feedback. High blood glucose levels cause insulin to be secreted by the pancreas. Insulin breaks down glucose and removes it from the blood. When glucose level drop, the pancreas stops receiving the signal to produce insulin, and glucose level stabilizes.
 
 That basic concept can be complicated by the fact that the stabilizing effect can be delayed and can cause the original quantity to stabilize at a different value than the one it started at. Let's illustrate that with an example. 
 
 a) Zara normally leaves work at 5pm. She finds that traffic is really bad at that time of day so one day she decides to leave at 6pm. There's less traffic at six but it's still a bit busy so the next day she leaves at 7pm. She finds that when she leaves at 7pm she doesn't have enough time to spend with her family so she starts leaving at 630pm. This gives her the right balance between reducing her commute and having family time.
 
 In this example, bad traffic causes a perturbation in Zara's departure time. Her departure continues to get later until she feels the stabilizing force of wanting to spend time with her family. This causes her to return to the stable value of 630pm.
 
 Some examples posted to the discussion forum involved scenarios where some quantity began to change due to some forcing effect and would continue to change until it found a new stable value, at which point it would stop changing. A couple of these examples were missing a stabilizing force. For example, in the above example, if Zara had simply changed her departure time from 5pm to 6pm, decided that was good enough and then set 6pm as her standard departure time, that would not be an example of feedback. There is no stabilizing force, just a stop in the perturbing force, the traffic. Recall once again that a feedback loop must loop. The initial change in a quantity must cause a secondary effect that causes further change in the quantity--in the opposite direction for stabilizing feedback and in the same direction for amplifying feedback.
 
 Once again, thanks to everyone who's posted a feedback example! Please reply to this thread if you found any of the above post unclear or confusing.

 I think that the food chain is the perfect model to describe a stabilizing feedback loop. For example, plants produce its own food from sunlight. Herbivore animals, get their energy from plants.
